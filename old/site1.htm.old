        <h3>Site 1</h3>
        <p>
Site One is located on the east side of the Main Street overpass. It consists of a large pool of water that is backed up as a consequence of the large concrete slab that supports the Main Street Bridge. Water moves over and spreads across the support slab at about a depth of 2-3 cm. The pool of water that preceeds the slab is approximately 1.5 meters at its deepest point. Site one has never been seen at a dangerously low level of water. Large carp have been observed at this location on many occasions. The water in site one has little to no flow and is fairly deep cpompared to the rest of the creek study area. DO tends to be lower, and nitrate and conductivity levels tend to be higher at this site compared to most other areas in the project study area

        <p>
          Site Two is located on the west side of the Main Street overpass. Water flowing across the slab spills over into a groove like pool. Water is deepest, approximately 1 meter, immediately next to the edge of the slab. Silt and gravel collects just beyond the slab and decreases the depth of the creek to about .5 meters and helps to establish the widest part of the creek. A large gravel/sand bar is easily accessible from the bank and allows access to sampling the deeper water on both sides of the bar. DO levels tend to be higher here than most other sites along the study area. Black bass, sculpin, squawfish, and creek chub have all been caught in the deep channel next to the spillway. Garbage is commonplace here, swept over the concrete slab and then getting caught in the backflow created by the spillway.

        <h3>Site 3</h3>
        <p>
          Site Three is one of the widest pools in the study site area. Except for an isolated depression near the bank on the north side, the depth is only about .5m. The steep bank makes collecting organisms from this site more difficult than most other sites. The north facing bank is inundated with blackberry bushes making the use of this side impossible. Fish are commonly seen here. A bull rush grows near the center of the pool. The slow rate of flow tends to allow a great deal of sediment to settle in this area forming a muddy bottom. Algae tends to be rather abundant along the north bank. A eucalyptus angles out over the water and creates an ideal location for sampling the water with the plankton net. The long handled dip net has been used at this location to collect aquatic insects and an occasional sculpin and bluegill.

        <h3>Site 4</h3>
        <p>
        Site Four is much like site three in that it is a wide shallow pool.Unlike site three, the north bank is not steep and offers easy access to the water's edge. It appears that high winter water has eroded away the bank to form a gradual incline. The bank has abundant grasses and a variety of algae at the water's edge and provides an ideal habitat for many aquatic invertebrate species. Bullfrogs often jump from the grasses at waters edge into deep water to seek refuge as students move in to collect samples. This is a prime dip net sampling location. A large metal pipe exists in the middle of the pool and fish are often seen taking shelter underneath it.The slow rate of flow tends to allow a great deal of sediment to settle in this area forming a muddy bottom

        <h3>Site 5</h3>
        <p>
  Site Five is where the width of the creek begins to narrow. The creek bed is composed of a mixture of mud, small river stones, and large gravel. Most of site five is fairly shallow, approximately 30-50cm during most of the year. On the opposite bank near the base of a tree the water gets up to about 1m deep and has significant shade. Many fish take refuge in this area.This site is a good location location for collecting fish and many species of invertebrates that are attached to the underside of rocks.This site receives significant shade and tends not to support abundant amounts of algae as is seen in other sites in the study area.

        <h3>Site 6</h3>
        <p>
          Site Six is a lagoon like body of water. The water that flows through the narrows of site five works its way around a small peninsula of soil and rock which supports an abundance of grasses and the trunk of a fallen tree. Water collects in a large, deep, stagnant pool. The pool appears to have been established by erosion that occurs during the heavy runoff of winter. The depth of the pool can be greater than 1m. DO levels tend to be low here due to the high rate of decomposition of organic matter that collects here. The path around site six and seven opens up into a large deposit of gravel offering students excellent access to the water.This area receives late morning and afternoon sun and therefore tends to support an abundance of algae. Bluegill have been observed here in small schools. Bullfrog tadpoles and mosquito fish often congregate in the shallows.

        <h3>Site 7</h3>
        <p>
Site Seven is a shallow area of the creek that rarely gets deeper than 50 cm and is usually 20-30cm deep. A large gravel bar allows students to congregate along waters edge and collect data. Grasses are anchored along the shallow bank and provide perfect cover for fish frye, mosquito fish, and insect larvae. The numerous rocks that can be found here at the creek bottom creates an ideal collecting spot for planaria. The bank on the south side receives significant shade and limits algae growth which makes access to organisms more manageable. At the west end of site seven the channel begins to narrow and leads to an area of faster flowing water which is the beginning of site 8.

        <h3>Site 8</h3>
        <p>
          Site Eight begins where site seven significantly narrows and leads to more rapidly moving water. Numerous fallen branches are often seen here. Water flow becomes somewhat turbulent and creates a very good location for using the kicknet. DO levels tend to be higher here than sites five, six, and seven due to water turbulence. Fish and other vertebrates are rarely seen here due to the shallow fast moving water. Garbage often collects in the tangle of fallen branches and creates an unattractive appearance warranting a significant amount of clean up each time we visit. At the western end of site eight the water depth quickly increases and gives way to site nine.

        <h3>Site 9</h3>
        <p>
Site Nine has much deeper water than located at sites seven and eight. The flowing water from site eight creates a steep bank at the eastern end of site nine. The bank is inundated with grasses, sedges and reeds many of which extend down into the water. This location is an ideal spot for collecting aquatic insects with the dip net. Dragonfly larvae and damselfly larvae are common here. We have even collected small bluegill which must be feeding on the numerous aquatic insects located at this site. The water that cuts a deep bank at the eastern end of site nine collects in a larger pool that ranges in depth from 50 cm to approximately 1 m. Fish are commonly observed in the deeper pool.

        <h3>Site 10</h3>
        <p>
          Site Ten is located in an area that has a large growth of eucalyptus and willow trees on the north bank. The north bank has a very gradual incline down to the water and provides ideal access to the water's edge. An abundance of rushes and bunch grasses along the bank creates an ideal habitat for many different species of aquatic invertebrates which makes this a prime location for collecting organisms with the dip net.. The creek is relatively wide and the rate of flow is slow. Due to the slow rate of flow, silt collects here and creates a muddy creek bed. Fanwort grows in abundance here. Rip rock lines the south bank which helps to establish the deepest parts of the study site.

        <p>
          Site Eleven is a very wide area of the creek located just before the railroad trestle. The water is slow moving here and exposed to full sun in the afternoon making this location ideal for algae growth. The bank is comparatively high above the water and covered in tall grasses which makes accessing the water for collecting data difficult. There is one opening where data can be collected if needed. An extensive growth of blackberry bushes is established on the south bank. The best way to collect data or organisms is by entering the creek channel with hip boots from the west end. Large bass, bluegill, and carp have been observed swimming up and down this site. A large tree branch near the end of site eleven provides excellent cover for the fish.

        <p>
          Site Twelve begins at the eastern side of the railroad trestle, goes under it, and ends just after the western side of the tressel. The creek channel n arrows here and establishes a rocky area where water flows quickly. There are two or three spots within site 12 that are ideal for collecting specimens using the kick net. In the winter of 2007 the flow of water was separated into two different paths just below the tressel. The flow of water on the northern bank was substantial during the early spring but had dried up by late spring killing most of the organisms established there. The flow of water closest to the south bank continued on through the summer. Water quality tends to be very good here as a consequence of the numerous rocks that the water flows over. This has been confirmed by the continued presence of caddisfly larvae

          Site Thirteen can be the deepest pool in the entire study site. This site is not exceptionally wide, the rate of flow is not slow, and the depth of the pool is the greatest of any site in the study area up to 1.75m. The water that feeds the pool is oxygenated by the water flowing over the rocks at site 12. Ideal conditions are established for fish as a result of high DO and an abundance of food scoured from the rocks. Black bass, squaw fish, creek chub, minnows, bluegill, and carp have all been seen here. A substantial amount of bunch grasses, reeds, and blackberry have established themselves on the north bank. There is one access point by a large rock but best access is by putting on waders and coming in from the western end of the pool.

        <h3>Site 14</h3>
        <p>
          Site Fourteen reveals a significant narrowing of the creek channel leading to rapid flow of water. Both sides of the channel are covered with grasses and reeds but accessing the creek is by no means difficult. An abundance of rocks on the creek bottom accompanied by the lush vegetation on both sides of the channel makes this site the most ideal spot for collecting organisms using the kick net. The presence of caddisfly larvae and dobsonfly larvae here suggests that water quality at this location tends to be good. There have been times when leeches, snails, and midge larvae were all that we collected here so conditions can change dramatically as a consequence of the amount of water passing through and toxic substances entering from upstream. This site can often be our best indicator of overall water quality in the creek.
