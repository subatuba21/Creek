Site Three is one of the widest pools in the study site area. Except for an isolated depression near the bank on the north side, the depth is only about .5m. The steep bank makes collecting organisms from this site more difficult than most other sites. The north facing bank is inundated with blackberry bushes making the use of this side impossible. Fish are commonly seen here. A bull rush grows near the center of the pool. The slow rate of flow tends to allow a great deal of sediment to settle in this area forming a muddy bottom. Algae tends to be rather abundant along the north bank. A eucalyptus angles out over the water and creates an ideal location for sampling the water with the plankton net. The long handled dip net has been used at this location to collect aquatic insects and an occasional sculpin and bluegill.
