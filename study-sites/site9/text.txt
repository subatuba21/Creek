Site Nine has much deeper water than located at sites seven and eight. The flowing water from site eight creates a steep bank at the eastern end of site nine. The bank is inundated with grasses, sedges and reeds many of which extend down into the water. This location is an ideal spot for collecting aquatic insects with the dip net. Dragonfly larvae and damselfly larvae are common here. We have even collected small bluegill which must be feeding on the numerous aquatic insects located at this site. The water that cuts a deep bank at the eastern end of site nine collects in a larger pool that ranges in depth from 50 cm to approximately 1 m. Fish are commonly observed in the deeper pool.
