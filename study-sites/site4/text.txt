Site Four is much like site three in that it is a wide shallow pool.Unlike site three, the north bank is not steep and offers easy access to the water's edge. It appears that high winter water has eroded away the bank to form a gradual incline. The bank has abundant grasses and a variety of algae at the water's edge and provides an ideal habitat for many aquatic invertebrate species. Bullfrogs often jump from the grasses at waters edge into deep water to seek refuge as students move in to collect samples. This is a prime dip net sampling location. A large metal pipe exists in the middle of the pool and fish are often seen taking shelter underneath it.The slow rate of flow tends to allow a great deal of sediment to settle in this area forming a muddy bottom.
