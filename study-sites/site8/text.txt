Site Eight begins where site seven significantly narrows and leads to more rapidly moving water. Numerous fallen branches are often seen here. Water flow becomes somewhat turbulent and creates a very good location for using the kicknet. DO levels tend to be higher here than sites five, six, and seven due to water turbulence. Fish and other vertebrates are rarely seen here due to the shallow fast moving water. Garbage often collects in the tangle of fallen branches and creates an unattractive appearance warranting a significant amount of clean up each time we visit. At the western end of site eight the water depth quickly increases and gives way to site nine.
