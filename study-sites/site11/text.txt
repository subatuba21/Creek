Site Eleven is a very wide area of the creek located just before the railroad trestle. The water is slow moving here and exposed to full sun in the afternoon making this location ideal for algae growth. The bank is comparatively high above the water and covered in tall grasses which makes accessing the water for collecting data difficult. There is one opening where data can be collected if needed. An extensive growth of blackberry bushes is established on the south bank. The best way to collect data or organisms is by entering the creek channel with hip boots from the west end. Large bass, bluegill, and carp have been observed swimming up and down this site. A large tree branch near the end of site eleven provides excellent cover for the fish.
