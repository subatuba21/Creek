Site Six is a lagoon like body of water. The water that flows through the narrows of site five works its way around a small peninsula of soil and rock which supports an abundance of grasses and the trunk of a fallen tree. Water collects in a large, deep, stagnant pool. The pool appears to have been established by erosion that occurs during the heavy runoff of winter. The depth of the pool can be greater than 1m. DO levels tend to be low here due to the high rate of decomposition of organic matter that collects here. The path around site six and seven opens up into a large deposit of gravel offering students excellent access to the water.This area receives late morning and afternoon sun and therefore tends to support an abundance of algae. Bluegill have been observed here in small schools. Bullfrog tadpoles and mosquito fish often congregate in the shallows.
