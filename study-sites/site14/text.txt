Site Fourteen reveals a significant narrowing of the creek channel leading to rapid flow of water. Both sides of the channel are covered with grasses and reeds but accessing the creek is by no means difficult. An abundance of rocks on the creek bottom accompanied by the lush vegetation on both sides of the channel makes this site the most ideal spot for collecting organisms using the kick net. The presence of caddisfly larvae and dobsonfly larvae here suggests that water quality at this location tends to be good. There have been times when leeches, snails, and midge larvae were all that we collected here so conditions can change dramatically as a consequence of the amount of water passing through and toxic substances entering from upstream. This site can often be our best indicator of overall water quality in the creek.
