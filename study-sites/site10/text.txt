Site Ten is located in an area that has a large growth of eucalyptus and willow trees on the north bank. The north bank has a very gradual incline down to the water and provides ideal access to the water's edge. An abundance of rushes and bunch grasses along the bank creates an ideal habitat for many different species of aquatic invertebrates which makes this a prime location for collecting organisms with the dip net.. The creek is relatively wide and the rate of flow is slow. Due to the slow rate of flow, silt collects here and creates a muddy creek bed. Fanwort grows in abundance here. Rip rock lines the south bank which helps to establish the deepest parts of the study site.
