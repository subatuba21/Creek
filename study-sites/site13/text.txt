Site Thirteen can be the deepest pool in the entire study site. This site is not exceptionally wide, the rate of flow is not slow, and the depth of the pool is the greatest of any site in the study area up to 1.75m. The water that feeds the pool is oxygenated by the water flowing over the rocks at site 12. Ideal conditions are established for fish as a result of high DO and an abundance of food scoured from the rocks. Black bass, squaw fish, creek chub, minnows, bluegill, and carp have all been seen here. A substantial amount of bunch grasses, reeds, and blackberry have established themselves on the north bank. There is one access point by a large rock but best access is by putting on waders and coming in from the western end of the pool.
