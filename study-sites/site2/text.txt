Site Two is located on the west side of the Main Street overpass. Water flowing across the slab spills over into a groove like pool. Water is deepest, approximately 1 meter, immediately next to the edge of the slab. Silt and gravel collects just beyond the slab and decreases the depth of the creek to about .5 meters and helps to establish the widest part of the creek. A large gravel/sand bar is easily accessible from the bank and allows access to sampling the deeper water on both sides of the bar. DO levels tend to be higher here than most other sites along the study area. Black bass, sculpin, squawfish, and creek chub have all been caught in the deep channel next to the spillway. Garbage is commonplace here, swept over the concrete slab and then getting caught in the backflow created by the spillway.
