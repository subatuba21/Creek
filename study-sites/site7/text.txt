Site Seven is a shallow area of the creek that rarely gets deeper than 50 cm and is usually 20-30cm deep. A large gravel bar allows students to congregate along waters edge and collect data. Grasses are anchored along the shallow bank and provide perfect cover for fish frye, mosquito fish, and insect larvae. The numerous rocks that can be found here at the creek bottom creates an ideal collecting spot for planaria. The bank on the south side receives significant shade and limits algae growth which makes access to organisms more manageable. At the west end of site seven the channel begins to narrow and leads to an area of faster flowing water which is the beginning of site 8.
