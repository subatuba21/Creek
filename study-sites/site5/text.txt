Site Five is where the width of the creek begins to narrow. The creek bed is composed of a mixture of mud, small river stones, and large gravel. Most of site five is fairly shallow, approximately 30-50cm during most of the year. On the opposite bank near the base of a tree the water gets up to about 1m deep and has significant shade. Many fish take refuge in this area.This site is a good location location for collecting fish and many species of invertebrates that are attached to the underside of rocks.This site receives significant shade and tends not to support abundant amounts of algae as is seen in other sites in the study area.
