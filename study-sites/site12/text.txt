Site Twelve begins at the eastern side of the railroad trestle, goes under it, and ends just after the western side of the tressel. The creek channel n arrows here and establishes a rocky area where water flows quickly. There are two or three spots within site 12 that are ideal for collecting specimens using the kick net. In the winter of 2007 the flow of water was separated into two different paths just below the tressel. The flow of water on the northern bank was substantial during the early spring but had dried up by late spring killing most of the organisms established there. The flow of water closest to the south bank continued on through the summer. Water quality tends to be very good here as a consequence of the numerous rocks that the water flows over. This has been confirmed by the continued presence of caddisfly larvae
