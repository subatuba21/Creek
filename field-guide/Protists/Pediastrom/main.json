{"organism":"yes","name":"Pediastrom","kingdom":"Protista","phylum":"Chlorophyta","class":"","order":"","family":"","genus":"","species":"","text":"Many different types of algae can be found in the creek. Green algae tends to be the most prolific (grows the fastest). The growth of this type of algae is most rapid in late spring and summer when temperatures are high and nutrient levels rise as a result of fertilizer runoff and increased rates of decomposition. The growth at this time significantly exceeds the rate of consumption by algae eaters. The small floating representatives of green algae can at this time cause the water to look green. Pediastrum is a small colonial planktonic green alga that forms colonies of 8 or 16 cells. The outer cells establish a spiky appearance that is likely to decrease herbivory. It is failry common to see one or more cells within the colony voided of its cytoplasmic content. We are not sure if this is an indication that sexual reproduction has occurred (conjugation) or if the cell have just died.","convertedName":"Pediastrom","link":11,"image":"images/Field_Guide/Protists/pediastrom.jpg"}
