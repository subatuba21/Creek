Green algae tends to be the most prolific (grows the fastest). The commonly observed green algae is seen in large mats floating on the surface and attached to the creek bottom. These large mats are a filamentous variety formed of clong chains of cells. The growth of this type of algae is most rapid in late spring and summer when temperatures are high and nutrient levels rise as a result of fertilzer runoff and increased rates of decomposition. The growth at this time significantly exceeds the rate of consumption by algae eaters leading to stagnation, an accumulation of decomposing organic matter, a decrease in dissolved oxygen levels below the mats of algae as a result of increased rates of decomposition, and a decline in the diversity of creek organisms. Cladophora is a filamentous green algae that forms branches along the chains of celss (upper right) and has a uniform distribution of chlorophyll within the cell. These two characteristics make it distinguisable from Spirogyra and Zygnema.","convertedName":"Cladophora","link":10,"image":"images/Field_Guide/Protists/cladophora.jpg"}
