Some are even able to grow out of water on moist surfaces. Protococcus is an alga that has that ability. It can commonly be seen growing on the trunks of trees when moisture is consistently made available (fog, rain, high humidity & shade). It appears as a light green covering (above right). Scraping some of this material, placing it on a slide and then looking at it under the microscope reveals that it is composed of small clusters of alga cells. My students have hypothesized that protococcus is likely to be a key alga associated with lichens but we have not yet been able to support that belief at this time.","convertedName":"Protococcus","link":8,"image":"images/Field_Guide/Protists/protococcus.jpg"}
