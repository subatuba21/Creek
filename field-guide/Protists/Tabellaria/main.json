{"organism":"yes","name":"Tabellaria","kingdom":"Protista","phylum":"Heterokontophyta","class":"Bacillariophyceae","order":"Pennales","family":"","genus":"","species":"","text":"Many different types of algae can be found in the creek. Yellow green / golden brown algae are common. Perhaps the most prolific and most important member of this phyla is a group of algae commonly called diatoms. They get this name due to the fact that their cell wall is composed of two parts. This group acts as the number one producer in the food chain of most aquatic systems. They alone are responsible for about 50% of the worlds atmospheric oxygen. Many species form chains of cells creating a diatom colony. They can be found floating on the surface, attached to rocks, and attached to other aquatic producers. Storing food products as oil helps many species float and remain exposed to maximum light intensity. As light becomes more intense ideal conditions exist for rapid blooms of diatoms which can change the color of the creek water to green, yellow green, or golden brown. Tabellaria forms colonies of cells that appear as blocks attached at one side. This may be a direct consequence of its method of asexually reproducing. The photograph below right reveals the photosynthetic plastids evident inside the Tabellaria cell.","convertedName":"Tabellaria","link":2,"image":"images/Field_Guide/Protists/tabellaria.jpg"}
