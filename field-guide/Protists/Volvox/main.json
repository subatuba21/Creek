{"organism":"yes","name":"Volvox","kingdom":"Protista","phylum":"Chlorophyta","class":"Chlorophyceae","order":"Volvocales","family":"Volvocaceae","genus":"Volvox","species":"","text":"Many different types of algae can be found in the creek. Green algae tends to be the most prolific (grows the fastest). The growth of this type of algae is most rapid in late spring and summer when temperatures are high and nutrient levels rise as a result of fertilzer runoff and increased rates of decomposition. The growth at this time significantly exceeds the rate of consumption by algae eaters leading to a change in color of the creek water to a light green. There are many planktonic green algae found in the creek. Volvox is a colonial green algae consisting of a ball of cells, many having flagella. The flagella are used to move the colony around in the water (see movie). Small daughter colonies may be present (dark circles within the colony) and support asexual reproduction. We have only seen Volvox once in the samples brought back to the classroom.","convertedName":"Volvox","link":7,"image":"images/Field_Guide/Protists/volvox.jpg"}
