{"organism":"yes","name":"Vorticella","kingdom":"Protista","phylum":"Ciliophora","class":"Oligohymenophorea","order":"Sessilida","family":"Vorticellidae","genus":"Vorticella","species":"","text":"Vorticella is the most commonly observed protozoan in our creek samples. This is likely due to the fact that they tend to attach themselves to filaments of algae with an elongated stalk. Being that their position is fixed and not constantly swimming quickly all over the place, they are more easily found and watched by students. Like paramecium, vorticella uses cilia for movement and feeding. A circular ring of cilia at the fringe of their bell shaped cell creates a current of water down into a pocket. Small bits of organic matter collect in the pocket where food vacuoles are formed which then enter the cell to distribute food. These organisms tend to be most commonly seen in small groups of 3-10 individuals. When startled they quickly contract their stalk and pull their bell shaped cell close to the surface that it is attached to. It is this jerky contraction that generally gives their location away to the student looking for organisms under the microscope. The image above was captured using a flex cam attached to a microscope and was photographed at 400x.
