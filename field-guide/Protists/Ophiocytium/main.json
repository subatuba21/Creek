Green algae tends to be the most prolific (grows the fastest). The growth of this type of algae is most rapid in late spring and summer when temperatures are high and nutrient levels rise as a result of fertilizer runoff and increased rates of decomposition. The growth at this time significantly exceeds the rate of consumption by algae eaters. The small floating representatives of green algae can at this time cause the water to look green. Ophiocytium is a small unicellular or colonial alagae. Collections of cells can form palm tree like shapes and an assortment of oddly configured colonies. While small in size their numbers can become so abundant that the water can become bright green.","convertedName":"Ophiocytium","link":12,"image":"images/Field_Guide/Protists/ophiocytium.jpg"}
