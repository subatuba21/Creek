Yellow green / golden brown algae are common. Perhaps the most prolific and most important member of this phyla is a group of algae commonly called diatoms. They get this name due to the fact that their cell wall is composed of two parts. This group acts as the number one producer in the food chain of most aquatic systems. They alone are responsible for about 50% of the worlds atmospheric oxygen. Many species form chains of cells creating a diatom colony. They can be found floating on the surface, attached to rocks, and attached to other aquatic producers. Storing food products as oil helps many species float and remain exposed to maximum light intensity (two oil vacuoles can be seen in the specimen above). As light becomes more intense ideal conditions exist for rapid blooms of diatoms which can change the color of the creek water to green, yellow green, or golden brown. The specimen above was photographed at 400x using a flex cam. Some students have hypothesized that this diatom represents one cell from a Fragilaria colony.","convertedName":"Unknown_Diatom","link":1,"image":"images/Field_Guide/Protists/diatom.gif"}
