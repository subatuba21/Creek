Green algae tends to be the most prolific (grows the fastest). The growth of this type of algae is most rapid in late spring and summer when temperatures are high and nutrient levels rise as a result of fertilizer runoff and increased rates of decomposition. The growth at this time significantly exceeds the rate of consumption by algae eaters. The small floating representatives of green algae can at this time cause the water to look green. Scenedesmus is a small planktonic green alga that forms colonies of 3 or 4 cells which appear to have spikes projecting out from either end of the colony. There extremely small size makes taking a high quality picture difficult. While small in size their numbers can become so abundant that the water can become bright green.","convertedName":"Scenedesmus","link":4,"image":"images/Field_Guide/Protists/scenedesmus.jpg"}
