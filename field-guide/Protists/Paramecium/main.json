{"organism":"yes","name":"Paramecium","kingdom":"Protista","phylum":"Ciliophora","class":"Ciliatea","order":"Hymenostomatida","family":"Parameciidae","genus":"Paramecium","species":"","text":"Paramecia are one celled animal like protists. They are commonly found swimming around in the algae samples brought back to class. Their \"footprint\" like shape and rapid swimming makes their identification comparatively easy. this protist is covered in minute hair like structures called cilia. The cilia are used to propel them through the water and assist them in collecting food. A groove can be seen on one side of the paramecium. As the organism swims through the water organic material and bacteria are funneled into the groove and eventually form a small pocket. The small membrane bound pocket, known as a food vacuole, breaks free of the groove and moves the nutrient material around inside the organism. Food vacuoles are usually distinguishable within the organism. On some occasions the contractile vacuole that pumps out excess water may also be visible. Because of their rapid movements photographing these organisms is difficult. The photo shown above was acquired from http://www.silkentent.com/gus1911/Paramecium.htm.
