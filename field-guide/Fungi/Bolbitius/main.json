It is during this time that temperatures in the creek channel get low enough in the morning to support the formation of dew on vegetation. Whether the dew assists in softening the soil enough for the mushrooms to appear is not clear at this point. They tend to be most common in soils that are above the high water mark of the creek and in areas where there is a significant amount of plant debris. These photographs were taken on the east side of the Main Street Bridge south of the trail in an area that is shaded for the morning hours by the eucalyptus trees near site 1. What we see as mushrooms is just the spore producing organ of the fungal body growing where decaying organic matter is abundant. In many species the cap will begin to curl up as it drys and realses it's spores. Three key features to look for when classifying a mushroom is the presence or absence of grooves under the cap (gills), the presence or absence of a scar on the stipe where the cap was connected (annulus), and the presence or absence of a cup at the base of the stipe (it may be necessary to wipe away leaf litter from the ground to determine this). Notice that the Bolbitius has well defined gills but no annulus or cup. Fungi are key decomposers in all ecosystems. Their activity helps to insure the recycling of matter into chemical nutrients essential for plant growth.","convertedName":"Bolbitius","link":2,"image":"images/Field_Guide/Fungi/bolbitius.jpg"}
