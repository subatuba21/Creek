It is during this time that temperatures in the creek channel get low enough in the morning to support the formation of dew on vegetation. Whether the dew assists in softening the soil enough for the mushrooms to appear is not clear at this point. They tend to be most common in soils that are above the high water mark of the creek and in areas where there is a significant amount of plant debris. This photograph was taken on the west side of the Main Street Bridge north of the trail near the storm drain and in an area that is shaded for most of the day. What we see as mushrooms is just the spore producing organ of the fungal body growing where decaying organic matter is abundant. Three key features to look for when classifying a mushroom is the presence or absence of grooves under the cap (gills), the presence or absence of a scar on the stipe where the cap was connected (annulus), and the presence or absence of a cup at the base of the stipe (it may be necessary to wipe away leaf litter from the ground to determine this). Fungi are key decomposers in all ecosystems. Their activity helps to insure the recycling of matter into chemical nutrients essential for plant growth.","convertedName":"Agaricaceae","link":0,"image":"images/Field_Guide/Fungi/agaricaceae.jpg"}
