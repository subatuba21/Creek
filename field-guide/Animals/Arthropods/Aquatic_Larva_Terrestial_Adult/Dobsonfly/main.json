{"organism":"yes","name":"Helgremite (Dobsonfly Larva)","kingdom":"Animal","phylum":"Arthropoda","class":"Insecta","order":"Megaloptera","family":"Corydalidae","genus":"","species":"","text":"Helgremites are found in kick net samples only when water quality is very good. These are the larva of the Dobsonfly. Most of the life of a dobsonfly is spent as a larva in aquatic systems. The adult may live for only a week while the larva may live for up to two years. The primary role of the adult is to mate and then lay eggs into the water. Helgremites feed on the larva of other insects and occasionally small unsuspecting fish. Their large jaws effectively imobilize it's prey. When ready to pupate into an adult they crawl onto land and form a cocoon. Helgremites are often purchased or collected by fisherman to use as bait.
