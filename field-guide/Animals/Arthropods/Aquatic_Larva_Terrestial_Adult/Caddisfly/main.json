{"organism":"yes","name":"Caddisfly Larva","kingdom":"Animal","phylum":"Arthropoda","class":"Insecta","order":"Trichoptera","family":"","genus":"","species":"","text":"Caddisflies are closely related to butterflies and moths because of the presence of scales on their wings. They lay their eggs in fresh water where the larvae will spend several months maturing. The larvae secrete silk fibers around themselves and then cement bits of organic matter or sand grains to the silk to form protective cases that is often well camouflaged. The very young caddisfly larva, below left, is inside it's protective case (the tip of my finger reveals the size of this larva). The larva will partially stick it's body out of the protective covering and uses it's fringed antennae and multiple mouth parts to collect a variety of different types of organic material as water flows by(movie - or movie). The image above shows a much more mature larva (1.5cm) laying down the silk covering while in a petri dish in the classroom. The caddisfly larvae are generally located in areas where water is moving fairly quickly. Caddisfly larvae have a very low tolerance for poor or moderate water quality and therefore are an excellent indicator species. Whe most commonly find them at site 8, 12, and 14 where water flow is at its greatest. The adult caddisfly has a very short life span (1-2 weeks) and often do not feed. Their primary objective is to mate and lay eggs.","convertedName":"Caddisfly_Larva","link":"10","image":"images/Field_Guide/Animals/Arthropods/caddisfly.jpg"}
