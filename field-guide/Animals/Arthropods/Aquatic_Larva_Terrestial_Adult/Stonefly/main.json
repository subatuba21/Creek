{"organism":"yes","name":"Stonefly","kingdom":"Animal","phylum":"Arthropoda","class":"Insecta","order":"Plecoptera","family":"","genus":"","species":"","text":"Stoneflies are a rare find in the creek channel. They are very sensitive to pollutants and therefore tend to be more readily found in areas where water is moving quickly or during the winter when water levels are high and pollutant concentration is low. Finding them in the creek channel is an indication that water quality is good. The stonefly nymph shown above right and again below left was discovered during December on the underside of a rock in an area where water was moving quickly. On this day water levels were comparitively high as a consequence of a series of days of light rainfall. Stonefly nymphs are mostly hunters of other small arthropods but have been known to eat deacying leaf litter when arthropod larav are in limited supply. The adults have large wings, fold flat over the back, and have elaborate branching veins visible in their wings. We have not yet seen an adult in the creek channel.","convertedName":"Stonefly","link":"8","image":"images/Field_Guide/Animals/Arthropods/stonefly.jpg"}
