Eggs are laid in the water and develop into a nymph stage (sometimes referred to as a larvae) that remains in the water until ready to emerge as the adult. The nymphs (below left) are carnivorous and as they mature they become excellent swimmers. Smaller nymphs eat small aquatic insects and worms. As they get larger they lay in wait for unsupecting small fish and tadpoles. They grab their prey with with extendable jaws. Adult dragonflies eat small insects which they are able to grab with their front appendages which are equipped with spikes that impail their prey. Dragon fly nymphs are sensitive to low dissolved oxygen levels and therefore can act as an indicator of water quality. The series of images below right were of a dragonfly that was raised in a classroom aquarium.
