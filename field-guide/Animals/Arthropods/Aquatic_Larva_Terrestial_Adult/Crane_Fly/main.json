{"organism":"yes","name":"Crane Fly","kingdom":"Animal","phylum":"Arthropoda","class":"Insecta","order":"Diptera","family":"Tipulidae","genus":"","species":"","text":"Crane Flies are often seen resting on the concrete walls of the Main Street Bridge in the morning hours. Their very long legs, narrow bodies, and elongate narrow wings make identification relatively easy. Vestigial wings can be seen just behind the flight wings (lower right). It is believed that these wing reminants may provide some form of stabilization during flight. Females will tend to have larger abdomens then males. This is a result of them often being full of eggs. The tip of the abdomen ends in a sharp tip (see above and below right) that aids in the laying of eggs (ovipositor). The adults have a very short life span that usually involves only mating and the laying of eggs. If the adults feed, they feed on the nectar of flowers and not mosquitoes, a common misconception. Most of their lives is spent as larva (below left) which are often referred to as \"leather jackets\". The larva may feed on the roots of grasses when in moist soil or on the larva of aquatic insects when in the water. Their posterior end las several fleshy lobes that surround the openings into their tracheal tubes. The tracheal tubes can be seen undulating as air is drawn into and forced out of them by muscular contraction (see movie). While in the water, the crane fly larvae will have their posterior end at the surface so that gas exchange is at the maximum.","convertedName":"Crane_Fly","link":"6","image":"images/Field_Guide/Animals/Arthropods/cranefly.jpg"}
