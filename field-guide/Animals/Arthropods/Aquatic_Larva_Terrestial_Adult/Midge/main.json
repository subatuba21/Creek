{"organism":"yes","name":"Midge - (true flies)","kingdom":"Animal","phylum":"Arthropoda","class":"Insecta","order":"Diptera","family":"","genus":"","species":"","text":"Kick net samples in the spring and fall commonly have midge larva present. The absence of legs, obvious well shaped head, and bristle like appendages at the tip of the abdomen are common characteristics. The bristle like structure help the larva anchor itself to algae, aquatic plants, and debris in the water. Midge larvae can tolerate poor water quality and endure low dissolved oxygen levels by floating to the surface and drawing in air. The adult flies are small and often very annoying. Some species bite and draw blood. Midge larvae can act as an excellent indicator species. A kick net sample collecting mostly midge larvae would reveal very poor water quality.","convertedName":"Midge_-_(true_flies)","link":3,"image":"images/Field_Guide/Animals/Arthropods/midge.jpg"}
