{"organism":"yes","name":"Mayfly","kingdom":"Animal","phylum":"Arthropoda","class":"Insecta","order":"Ephemeroptera","family":"","genus":"","species":"","text":"Mayflies are most commonly found at the creek in during the spring. The larvae are usually collected using the kicknet but are also sometimes collected with the plankton net as well. The larvae have narrow bodies, three tails, and gills on both sides of the abdomen. While watching them under the microscope the gills can be seen moving back and forth fanning water over their surfaces. The larvae feed on algae and diatoms that grow on the surfaces of rocks. Their flattened bodies reduce drag from the flow of water enabling them to live in stream like conditions. Once the larvae has gone through as many as 50 molts, it will begin to develop wing pads that will eventually mature into wings. It is at this point that the adult crawls up on plant material to allow their wings to dry and then take flight for the purpose of mating. The emergence of adult mayflies often occurs in great numbers. Small clouds of adults have been observed at dusk above the surface of the creek. The adults live for as little as 30 minutes to as much as a day. Their only purpose is to mate and lay eggs.","convertedName":"Mayfly","link":"7","image":"images/Field_Guide/Animals/Arthropods/mayfly.jpg"}
