In the creek study site they often have small narrow bodies that resemble a wasp and have colorations that tend to mimic local wasp color. Eggs are laid in organic matter where the larvae (movie) eat and grow until they for puppa. The larava is maggot like and uses special mouth parts (below left) to ingulf their food as they move through organis material. The puppa of this fly and other species are often found attached to rocks in the shallow areas of the creek and appears as a golden brown oval shaped structure often around 1cm in length. The adults are very difficult to approach when attempting to photograph.
