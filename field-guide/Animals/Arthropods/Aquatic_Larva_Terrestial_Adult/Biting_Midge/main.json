{"organism":"yes","name":"Biting Midge","kingdom":"Animal","phylum":"Arthropoda","class":"Insecta","order":"Diptera","family":"","genus":"","species":"","text":"At first look the larvae of biting midges look like round worms (see movie). A closer look shows that their bodies are obviously segmented, with eyes and jaws at the anterior end, and breathing appendages at the posterior end (see movie). The larvae feed mainly on decaying organic matter in the mud. Adults feed on fluids acquired from both plants and animals. The adult flies are small and often very annoying. Much like mosquitoes, the females bite and draw blood in order to support the development of their eggs. The bristle like structures at the posterior end of the larvae aid in acquiring oxygen from the air when dissolved oxygen is very low. Biting midge larvae can tolerate poor water quality and endure low dissolved oxygen levels by floating to the surface and drawing in air. A plankton net sample collecting many biting midgefly larvae can offer evidence taht the water quality is poor. The images captured were acquired using a \"FlexCam\". The image lower left was using the FlexCam only at a distance of approximately 3cm away from the dish holding the specimen. The image captured at the upper right taken using the FlexCam attached to a microscope at 100x.","convertedName":"Biting_Midge","link":2,"image":"images/Field_Guide/Animals/Arthropods/bitingmidge.jpg"}
