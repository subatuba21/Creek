{"organism":"yes","name":"Snakefly","kingdom":"Animal","phylum":"Arthropoda","class":"Insecta","order":"Raphidioptera","family":"Raphidiodea","genus":"","species":"","text":"This specimen was photographed on Foxtail reeds located at site 6. Transparent wings with branched veins accompanied by an elongate prothorax and raised head make identification fairly easy. Snakeflies are very similar to mantidflies with the main difference being that their first pair of legs are used for walking and not modified for grasping as is the case with the mantid variety. The adults and larvae feed primarily on small insects like aphids and caterpillars and as a consequence are considered beneficial insects in the garden. The specimen shown in this photograph reveals the presence of an elongated ovipositor characteristic of females. Eggs are laid in the crevices of bark on deciduous trees. The larvae have cryptic coloration making it very difficult to notice their presence.","convertedName":"Snakefly","link":18,"image":"images/Field_Guide/Animals/Arthropods/snakefly.jpg"}
