The adults will forage on the pollen and petals of flowers. Eggs are laid in the ground about 4-5 inches below the surface. The larva commonly eat the roots of grasses and weeds. While they do assist in the act of pollination they do not support the transfer of pollen to the same degree as honey bees and bumble bees which are far more commonly seen visiting the flowers in the study site.","convertedName":"June_Beetle","link":10,"image":"images/Field_Guide/Animals/Arthropods/junebeetle.jpg"}
