{"organism":"yes","name":"Sowbug","kingdom":"Animal","phylum":"Arthropoda","class":"Crustacea","order":"Isopoda","family":"Armadillidiidae","genus":"","species":"","text":"Sowbugs, (also known as pillbugs, rolly pollies, potato bugs, and wood lice) are commonly seen throughout the study site. They tend to be most common in areas subjected to significant amounts of shade or areas where moisture is plentiful. Site 2, where the Main Street bridge casts a large shadow and storm drains deliver water to the creek site, is an area where they are commonly found. Sowbugs are dependent upon moist environments due to the presence of gills on the underside of their jointed carapace. When disturbed they typically roll into a ball (lower left) to protect their legs, antennae, and gills, the most vulnerable parts of their body. Sowbugs have very few predators due to their protective carapace. Parasitic flies and wasps tend to keep the sow bug populations in check. Sowbug feeding habits usually involve eating decaying plant matter which would classify them as a detrivore.","convertedName":"Sowbug","link":"17","image":"images/Field_Guide/Animals/Arthropods/sowbug.jpg"}
