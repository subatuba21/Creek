{"organism":"yes","name":"Tailless Scorpion","kingdom":"Animal","phylum":"Arthropoda","class":"Arachnida","order":"Amblypigi","family":"","genus":"","species":"","text":"Tailless scorpions are members of the class Arachnida. They are related to spiders, ticks, mites, and solpugids. They have 2 body segments (cephalothorax and abdomen) and four pairs of legs (some of the legs of this specimen were lost during capture). The pedipalps have the form of \"pinchers\" unlike spiders where they are small versions of their walking legs. The tailless scorpion is mostly carnivorous feeding primarily on a variety of insects. This specimen was found at the western most tip of site 14 in the eucalyptus leaf litter. Notice the large eyes on the top of the head. The location of eyes high on top of the head increases the scorpions ability to see their prey several centimeters ahead of it's position enabling them to move stealthily toward their victims.","convertedName":"Tailless_Scorpion","link":4,"image":"images/Field_Guide/Animals/Arthropods/scorpion.jpg"}
