They seem to appear in late spring and last through summer and early fall. When startled they will hop into the air and fly short distances to elude potential danger. As they fly their wings create a very characteristic sound that quickly reveals their identity. Most possess a yellow coloration on their wings that is clearly visible when in flight but generally not visible while on the ground. All species of grasshopper are herbivorous and thrive on grain producing grasses.","convertedName":"Grasshopper","link":12,"image":"images/Field_Guide/Animals/Arthropods/grasshopper.jpg"}
