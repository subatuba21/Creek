{"organism":"yes","name":"Buckeye","kingdom":"Animal","phylum":"Arthropoda","class":"Insecta","order":"Lepidoptera","family":"Nymphalidae","genus":"Junonia","species":"coenia","text":"The buckeye butterfly is a common visitor to the creek community. It is typically seen flying around the dry creek trail and along the dry grass banks of the creek channel during the late spring and summer months. When it settles on the ground the eye markings on its wings resemble what appears to be the face of a lizard or snake. This mimicry may be it's most successful line of defense against predators. The adults feed on nectar from flowers and often draw up water from mud or wet sand. The larva feed on the plants that the eggs are laid onto by the female. This can sometimes include weeds like Plantain which is commonly found along the creek channel.","convertedName":"Buckeye","link":2,"image":"images/Field_Guide/Animals/Arthropods/buckeye.jpg"}
