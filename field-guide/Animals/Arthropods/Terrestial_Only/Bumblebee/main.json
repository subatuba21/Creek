They seem to be most abundant when thr blackberry bushes are in bloom. The photograph above shows a bumblebee on a blackberry flower. They are very easy to identify with their large fuzzy bodies usualy banded in black and yellow. Sometimes all black indivduals have been observed. Bumblebees feed on nectar and collect pollen for feeding their young. Notice the pollen stored on the hairs of the hind legs of the bee above. Like the honey bee they will sting when aggravated but no student has been stung during the entire history of the creek project.","convertedName":"Bumblebee","link":"7","image":"images/Field_Guide/Animals/Arthropods/bumblebee.jpg"}
