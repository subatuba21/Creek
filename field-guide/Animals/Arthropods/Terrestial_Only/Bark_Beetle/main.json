As a result of their discovery we have decided to nickname this arthropod \"ElizhaPav\". It was observed on Foxtail reeds at site six. The flat bark beetle is more typically found on the ground under bark chips. Both the adults and the larvae feed on the pupa and larvae of other insects. It possesses powerful mandibles that it uses to capture and consume it's prey. This adult may have been out on the reeds attempting to attract a mate.","convertedName":"Flat_Bark_Beetle_(ElizhaPav)","link":19,"image":"images/Field_Guide/Animals/Arthropods/barkbeetle.jpg"}
