This may be a consequence of them favoring conditions that make finding them difficult for the casual observer. Millipedes area characterized by multiple body segments and two pair of legs per segment. They feed on plant litter and would tend to be most abundant in shaded areas where debris from plants accumulates. They are harmless organisms and interesting to observe. They often are mistaken for centipedes which also have many body segments but only one pair of legs per segment. Unlike the millipede, centipedes are carnivourous and some species may be potentially dangerous.:","convertedName":"Millipede","link":"16","image":"images/Field_Guide/Animals/Arthropods/millipede.jpg"}
