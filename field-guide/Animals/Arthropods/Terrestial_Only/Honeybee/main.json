{"organism":"yes","name":"HoneyBee","kingdom":"Animal","phylum":"Arthropoda","class":"Insecta","order":"Hymenoptera","family":"Apidae","genus":"Apis","species":"","text":"Honey bees can be seen in the study site whenever flowers are in bloom. They are most abundant in spring when flowers are in greatest abundance. Blackberry bushes produce numerous flowers in mid spring and this is when we see the greatest number of honey bees in the study site. the honey bee seems to be the most common insect seen visiting the flowers of our creek plants and therefore would likely be the most significant pollinator. This is a bit of a concern considering the fact that the abundance of honey bees in the study area has noticeably decreased over the years. When we first started visiting the creek in 1994 & 95 it would not be uncommon for several students to have a close encounter with honey bees while collecting data. In the spring of 2008 we might have seen 1/10th of what we had seen 14 years earlier. Whatever seems to be impacting the success of honey bees appears not to have as much of an impact on bumble bees. Their numbers are noticeably higher than what we had witnessed in the mid and late 1990's.","convertedName":"HoneyBee","link":8,"image":"images/Field_Guide/Animals/Arthropods/honeybee.jpg"}
