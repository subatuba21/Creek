{"organism":"yes","name":"Anise Swallowtail","kingdom":"Animal","phylum":"Arthropoda","class":"Insecta","order":"Lepidoptera","family":"Papilionidae","genus":"Papilio","species":"zelicaon","text":"The Anise Swallowtail larva become common in the spring. Eggs are laid on anise plants (wild licorice) and develop into a caterpillar that feeds ravenously on on the leaves and flowers of the anise plant. Growth is rapid if on a healthy plant. Egg to adult can be complete in three weeks.We raised three caterpillars to adult in my classroom and then released them back into the creek study site. The collage below shows reveals many of the critical stages in the metamorphosis of the swallowtail. The first instar looks very much like bird dung on the anise plant. As it matures it molts several times and transforms into a bright green and yellow caterpillar that grew to almost 8cm. Notice the silk straps used by the caterpillar to anchor it to the top of its enclosure at the beginning of the pupa stage (bottom left). The adults feed on nectar from a variety of wildflowers all of which are abundant at the creek in the spring. Anise can be found all along the South facing hillside of the creek channel.","convertedName":"Anise_Swallowtail","link":1,"image":"images/Field_Guide/Animals/Arthropods/aniseswallowtail.jpg"}
