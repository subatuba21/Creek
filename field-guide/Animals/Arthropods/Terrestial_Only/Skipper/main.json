They are common visitors at the creek study site when flowers are in bloom. They feed on the nectar of flowers using a tube like mouthpart that can siphon the nectar from deep within the flower (siphoning mouthpart is evident in the image above). Like all butterflies, the skipper keeps the mouthpart coiled up below the head when not in use (the two images shown below shows the mouthpart being coiled up).","convertedName":"Skipper","link":0,"image":"images/Field_Guide/Animals/Arthropods/skipper.jpg"}
