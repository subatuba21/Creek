{"organism":"yes","name":"Garden Spider","kingdom":"Animal","phylum":"Arthropoda","class":"Arachnida","order":"Araneae","family":"Araneidae","genus":"Argiope","species":"aurantia","text":"A large variety of spiders can be found in and around the creek area. This spider is the common garden spider Argiope. It was found in the eucalyptus leaves at creek site 5. Argiope forms rather large webs in branches where breezes are common making the capture of it's prey more productive. It feeds primarily on flying insects. Argiope has very distinct coloration. The dorsal surface (as shown below) has very recognizeable black, yellow, and green markings. The ventral surface (shown above) while not as striking, has the same combination of colors. This species of spider can get quite large having an abdomen of over 2cm in width. Argiope is of no danger to humans but will bite if provoked.","convertedName":"Garden_Spider","link":6,"image":"images/Field_Guide/Animals/Arthropods/gardenspider.jpg"}
