Their markings are very distinctive and make identification fairly easy. The Painted Lady has predominantly orange wings with with black and white markings. The forewings have black tips with four or more white dots at the margins. Like all butterflies they feed on the nectar of flowers. Their eggs are laid on thistle, cheeseweed, dwarf nettle, and lupine all of which have been observed in the creek channel. Their larvae range in color as they mature from white with a black head in the first instar to black with orange spots and finally to a green/yellow/orange mix. The black instar stage resembles a bird dropping on a leaf. The Painted Lady is believed to be one of the most widely distributed butterfly species and have been documented migrating great distances to follow the availability of flower nectar.
