When hunting, mantises remain motionless on vegetation waiting for prey to land near by. Their front legs are equipped with sharp spikes that enable them to clasp and impail their prey. When prey is spotted the mantis will make minimal movement until the prey is within range and then strikes with amazing speed and pinpoint accuracy. Their large compound eyes accompanied by a head with remarkable articulation enables them to see 360 degrees. After spotting this specimen fly into some vegetation we approached it very carefully so as not to disturb it and cause it to fly away. It stayed motionless for several minutes and allowed easy access for photography. Mantids may stay in areas where hunting is successful. The images below are of the same mantis which was observed for three weeks in the same vegetation it was originally spotted. The photos below show it eating a butterfly commonly referred to as a skipper.","convertedName":"Mantis","link":13,"image":"images/Field_Guide/Animals/Arthropods/mantis.jpg"}
