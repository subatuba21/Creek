There are parasitic, mutualistic, and parasitic species. Finding mites in algae samples is not uncommon. Unfortunately we have no way of determining their exact method of food acquisition. Our fresh water biology field guide suggest that this species may be parasitic to insect larva. This mite was collected with the plankton net. It was large enough to see as a spot swimming rapidly around in the water in which it was collected. There were several collected in one plankton draw in October 2008. The photograph was captured using a flex cam attached to a microscope set at 100 magnification.","convertedName":"WaterMite","link":"5","image":"images/Field_Guide/Animals/Arthropods/watermite.jpg"}
