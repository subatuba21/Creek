There is no way to determine what this larva may have developed into other than some form of crustacean. The nauplius larvae filters algae and other organic substances as it swims through the water by using its paired appendages. The single compound eye in the center of the head enable the Nauplius larva to swim to areas where algae is likely to be abundant. The nauplius shown above was caught using the plankton net and photographed with the Motic 2300 microscope camera coupled to the ocular lens of a compound light microscope. The specimen was photographed at 100 magnification.","convertedName":"Nauplius_Larva","link":"6","image":"images/Field_Guide/Animals/Arthropods/nauplius.jpg"}
