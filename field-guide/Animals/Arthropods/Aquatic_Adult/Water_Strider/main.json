{"organism":"yes","name":"Water Strider","kingdom":"Animal","phylum":"Arthropoda","class":"Insecta","order":"Hemiptera","family":"Gerridae","genus":"","species":"","text":"Water striders are found in most of the areas of the creek where water flow extremely calm or stopped. Their ability to rest on the surface is a direct result of their \"non-wetting\" leggs. Numerous microscopic hairs prevent water from clingling to the animals legs. They feed on small insects, both dead and alive, that float up to or drop into the water. Like all Hemiptera (the \"true bugs\") they possess piercing and sucking mouthparts. They pierce their prey with a syringe like tube, inject digestive enzymes, and then suck out the organisms body fluids. As a result of their ability to stay above the surface of the water they tend to be very tolerant of poor water quality. Baby water striders (lower left - picture taken using the flex cam) are often collected in larger numbers when plankton nets are dragged through the water close to the creek bank.","convertedName":"Water_Strider","link":"7","image":"images/Field_Guide/Animals/Arthropods/waterstrider.jpg"}
