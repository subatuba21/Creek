{"organism":"yes","name":"Green Heron","kingdom":"Animal","phylum":"Chordata","class":"Aves","order":"Ciconiiformes","family":"Ardeidae","genus":"Butorides","species":"virescens","text":"Green Herons, like egrets, have only been seen in the study site in the morning hours duirng spring, summer, and fall months. Approaching the creek study site in a way that does not startle this species is very difficult to achieve. When going to the study site in the morning I have my classes be very quiet as we approach hoping to see them if possible or at least hear them in the distance. When I have visited the creek by myself I have watched them hunting for fish and amphibians, their favorite food. My classes have only witnessed them flying away from the site as a result of being spooked by our appearance. Students have stated that they see them all the time in the creek that runs paralell to the 680 freeway. I have never been able to photograph them at the creek.
