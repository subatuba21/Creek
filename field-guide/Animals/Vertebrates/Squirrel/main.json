{"organism":"yes","name":"Tree Squirrel ( Fox Squirrel?)","kingdom":"Animal","phylum":"Chordata","class":"Mammalia","order":"Rodentia","family":"Sciuridae","genus":"Sciurus","species":"","text":"Tree squirrels are a common sight in the study area. They are often seen in the almond trees at site one, eucalyptus trees at site six, and the cottonwoods seen at site two and ten. In the fall their nests become quite apparent among the branches in the trees (lower left). In the spring males will often chase each other and fight rather aggressively. It is at this time that they seem to be oblivious to our presence and make themselves very visible. Photographing them is difficult because they are usually seen in trees and they rarely stay still long enough to get an un blurry image. The image displayed above was captured by waiting for several minutes behind a pine tree near the trail head. Tree squirrels are omnivorous, eating nuts and seeds but will also eat insects and small vertebrates if the opportunity presents itself.","convertedName":"Tree_Squirrel_(_Fox_Squirrel?)","link":27,"image":"images/Field_Guide/Animals/Vertebrates/squirrel.jpg"}
