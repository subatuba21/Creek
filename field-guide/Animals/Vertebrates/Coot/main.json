{"organism":"yes","name":"Coot (mud hen)","kingdom":"Animal","phylum":"Chordata","class":"Aves","order":"Gruiformes","family":"Rallidae","genus":"Fulica","species":"","text":"Coots are most commonly seen in the fall and almost always in the morning hours. While mallards tend to be always present, coots are a little more sensitive to the presence of people and are usually gone from the study area before 11am. These ducks are herbivorous eating algae, aquatic plans, and grasses. They seem to prefer areas where significant vegetation, like arrundo, provides a great deal of cover. This specimen was photographed as it attempted to move from our field of view into branches at site 4 that lined the creek bank. The black and gray feathers and dark black head feathers clearly identify this waterfowl as a coot.","convertedName":"Coot_(mud_hen)","link":25,"image":"images/Field_Guide/Animals/Vertebrates/coot.jpg"}
