They are most commonly seen in the water or reeds along the creek bank. These animals will eat frogs, fish, large insects, or small rodents. They depend mostly on a quick strike and holding onto their prey with their powerful jaws. In the event that the prey may be large enough to wiggle out of the snakes grasp, the animal will wrap the rest of it's body around it to decrease the chance of escape. This animal was photographed hiding in a small bush at waters edge. Their yellow stripes along the body make their identification relatively easy. This specimen measured approximately 52cm.","convertedName":"Garter_Snake","link":10,"image":"images/Field_Guide/Animals/Vertebrates/gartersnake.jpg"}
