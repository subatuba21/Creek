{"organism":"yes","name":"American Robin","kingdom":"Animal","phylum":"Chordata","class":"Aves","order":"Passeriformes","family":"Turdidae","genus":"Turdus","species":"migratorius","text":"Robins are commonly heard in the tree branches above us as we collect data in the late fall through early spring. On occasion they will fly to the creek edge and bathe in small pools of water (below right). The image of an adult robin at the upper right was acquired from the 10,000 birds website. As a consequence of our creek robins being fairly shy birds and staying some distance away in the trees, we have not yet been able to capture an image of an adult. The image below right, we believe to be that of a juvenile robin, was photographed just before the bird began to bathe. Robins are omnivorous eating a variety of fruit, insects, and worms.","convertedName":"American_Robin","link":14,"image":"images/Field_Guide/Animals/Vertebrates/robin.jpg"}
