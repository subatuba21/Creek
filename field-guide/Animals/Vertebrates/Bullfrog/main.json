{"organism":"yes","name":"Bullfrog","kingdom":"Animal","phylum":"Chordata","class":"Amphibia","order":"Anura","family":"Ranidae","genus":"Rana","species":"catesbeiana","text":"Bullfrogs are an invasive species that are very agressive and force native species out of their habitat. They are most abundant in the spring and best observed late in the afternoon. tadpoles eat primarily algae while the adults are carnivorous eating a variety of insects, worms, small fish, and even have been observed eating ducklings. Bullfrogs used to be commonly found at site 4 sunning themselves among the branches that rest in the water at this location. Their tadpoles were most abundant at sites 6, 7, and 10. The largest specimen caught has been 42cm from tip of snout to tip of stretched out hind legs. It wasn't uncommon to find tadpoles about 12cm long. Due to their extremely thin skin frogs and other amphibians can act as excellent indicators of poor water quality. An abundance of tadpoles were observed in the Spring of 1999 but only two adults were seen. Year after year the number of adults seen in the study site has continued to decrease since 1997 when they were last seen in relative abundance. Tadpoles are seen on occasion and an adult can be heard from time to tine jumping into the water to avoid contact with us as we move into an area to study a specific site. We see three possible explanations for their decline. Poor water quality, decline in tadpoles numbers due to predation by a now large black bass popluation, or our continued presence at the creek has scared them to other areas. All three are likely to blame. Since the 2007 school year, no adults or tadpoles have been observed in the study area.","convertedName":"Bullfrog","link":7,"image":"images/Field_Guide/Animals/Vertebrates/bullfrog.jpg"}
