In areas that receive significant amounts of sunlight and have either fallen branches or large rocks are an ideal location for these vertebrates. This specimen was collected in an area near site 14 that had several large concrete blocks along the creek channel. Shortly after its capture the tip of it's tail broke free as parts of it's normal defense mechanism. When turned on it's back it became calm and did not move (as if playing dead) displaying another defense mechanism. The blue patches on it's ventral surface offer clear evidence as how it has been given the commom name of blue belly.","convertedName":"Blue_Belly_(western_fence_lizard)","link":8,"image":"images/Field_Guide/Animals/Vertebrates/bluebelly.jpg"}
