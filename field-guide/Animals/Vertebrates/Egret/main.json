Approaching the creek study site in a way that does not startle this species is very difficult to achieve. We have on more than one occasion heard egrets as we approached thye study site. When I have visited the creek by myself I have watched them hunting for fish and amphibians, their favorite food. My classes have only seen them flying away from the site as a result of being spooked by our appearance. Students have stated that they see them all the time in the creek that runs paralell to the 680 freeway. I have never been able to photograph them at the creek.
