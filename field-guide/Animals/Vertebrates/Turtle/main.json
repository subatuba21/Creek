There have been only two sightings by my classes since the study began in 1994. This specimen was sunning itself on a well known branch at site four in the spring of 2006. We were too far away to get a good read on the species of this turtle but believe it was a common pond variety. Pond Turtles are omnivorous and scavengers. It most likely eats aquatic insects, small frogs, worms, small crawdads, fish when the opportunity presents itself, and some plants.","convertedName":"Pond_Turtle","link":11,"image":"images/Field_Guide/Animals/Vertebrates/turtle.jpg"}
