{"organism":"yes","name":"Mallard Duck","kingdom":"Animal","phylum":"Chordata","class":"Aves","order":"Anseriformes","family":"Anatidae","genus":"Anas","species":"platyrhynchos","text":"Mallards are a common sight at the creek. There seems to always be a mating pair present. The males are clearly recognizable with their green head feathers. The females are beige with brown and white highlights. Hearing them while foraging for food or interacting during the mating season is very recognizable. We have witnessed on three different occasions a female with ducklings (lower right). An abandoned duckling was found at the end of the school year in 2000. It was taken home by a student, raised, and then released back into the creek. In the late spring of 2008 we came across a nest that was hidden among the blackberry bushes near site 13 (lower left). Mallards eat primarily plant material and can be seen browsing on algae and grasses.","convertedName":"Mallard_Duck","link":24,"image":"images/Field_Guide/Animals/Vertebrates/mallard.jpg"}
