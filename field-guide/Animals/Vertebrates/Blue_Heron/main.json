{"organism":"yes","name":"Great Blue Heron","kingdom":"Animal","phylum":"Chordata","class":"Aves","order":"Ciconiiformes","family":"Ardeidae","genus":"Ardea","species":"herodias","text":"Herons and egrets are very shy birds and can only be seen hunting in the creek for food (fish and amphibians) when we approach the study site very quietly. We have heard blue herons as we approached the creek and have witnessed them flying away from the study site on several occasions. Students are impressed by the huge wing span and the beautiful grayish blue feathers. It's huge size leaves a long lasting impression on those that are lucky enough to see it fly overhead. On May 26, 2009, I visited the creek at 3:30 in the afternoon to collect some water samples for a demonstration. While at the creek I noticed the heron shown above fishing. As it moved in the shallows it's head and neck movements brought back memories of Jurassic Park Velociraptors. While I was able to capture an image with my camera it was from a considerable distance away. The point and shoot Casio camera does not have the telephoto capability that I would have liked to get an exceptional image, but it is definately better than no image. The image below left was captured at a closer distance but through the willows on the bank at site 4.","convertedName":"Great_Blue_Heron","link":21,"image":"images/Field_Guide/Animals/Vertebrates/blueheron.jpg"}
