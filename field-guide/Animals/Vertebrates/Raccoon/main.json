{"organism":"yes","name":"Raccoon","kingdom":"Animal","phylum":"Chordata","class":"Mammalia","order":"Carnivora","family":"Procyonidae","genus":"Procyon","species":"lotor","text":"Raccoons are nocturnal and therefore have not been seen during our time at the creek. Evidence of their presence is everywhere in the form of footprints (upper right) in the moist mud and mounds of empty clam shells (lower left) . Raccoons are omnivores and eat a variety of different animals that they may come across as well as fruit and nuts. Raccoons may appear cute and friendly but they can be extremely aggressive if cornered. Feeding them is not advised because it can lead to the animals becoming a nuisance around your home, dependent upon unnatural sources of food, and because it is not uncommon for them to be infected with rabies. Wild animals are best left wild. Raccoon picture lower right was acquired from gotpets online.","convertedName":"Raccoon","link":28,"image":"images/Field_Guide/Animals/Vertebrates/raccoon.jpg"}
