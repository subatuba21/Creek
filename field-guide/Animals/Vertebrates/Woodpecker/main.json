{"organism":"yes","name":"Nuttall's Woodpecker","kingdom":"Animal","phylum":"Chordata","class":"Aves","order":"Piciformes","family":"Picidae","genus":"Dryocopus","species":"pileatus","text":"It is not uncommon for the students to hear the sound of a woodpecker as we approach the study area. It is uncommon for us to spot the bird as we move into the area where the sound is coming from. We have seen the Nuttall's Woodpecker about 6 times during the start of the study in 1994 but have heard them working many more times than that. They appear to be most active in the spring but are not uncommon in the winter months as well. They generally work on dead trees (commonly found at site 6, 8, and 10) to create large holes in which to lay their eggs. This bird tends to be omnivorous feeding on beetles, insect larva, and small fruit. It's coloration makes identification very easy. The black and white markings with red on the top of it's head are a dead giveaway.","convertedName":"Nuttall's_Woodpecker","link":12,"image":"images/Field_Guide/Animals/Vertebrates/woodpecker.jpg"}
