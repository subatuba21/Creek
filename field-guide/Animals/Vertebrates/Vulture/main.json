{"organism":"yes","name":"Turkey Vulture","kingdom":"Animal","phylum":"Chordata","class":"Aves","order":"Ciconiiformes","family":"Cathartidae","genus":"Cathartes","species":"aura","text":"The Turkey Vulture is often seen soaring overhead the study area. On occasion they have been seen perching at the tops of Eucalyptus trees at the North end of site 1often making calls to other vultures. In October 1996 an herbacide was dumped into a storm drain that flowed into the study area. Hundreds of dead fish were observed from site 1 through 14. Dead carp exceeding 25cm were common. On this day more than a dozen Turkey vultures were seen perching in the trees. The vulture below left was hesitant to fly and stood open winged for several minutes. This pose was perpendicular to the rising sun on a chilly morning which suggested to us that the bird was attempting to warm its body temperature. The red head, black feathers, and the use of thermals to soar with few if any wing flaps (lower right) are trademark charcteristics. Their remarkable sense of smell can enable them to sense carrion (dead animals) many miles away.","convertedName":"Turkey_Vulture","link":19,"image":"images/Field_Guide/Animals/Vertebrates/vulture.jpg"}
