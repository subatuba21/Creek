{"organism":"yes","name":"Blue Gray Gnat Catcher","kingdom":"Animal","phylum":"Chordata","class":"Aves","order":"Passeriformes","family":"Sylviidae","genus":"Polioptila","species":"","text":"This small gray bird is commonly seen flying in groups. The upper or back part of the body is a darker gray than it's underbelly. They are extremely active jumping and flying from branch to branch. They make a constant chirp sound as they move from tree to tree. The high level of activity displayed by these small birds is believed to help stir up small insects for them to eat. These birds have been most commonly seen in the fall months. Our observations suggest that the Arroyo may simply be a temporary feeding area during it's migration rather than a permanent residence. While this picture is in no way ideal, we were fortunate to have it because capturing any picture is difficult as a consequence of their constant movement.","convertedName":"Blue_Gray_Gnat_Catcher","link":16,"image":"images/Field_Guide/Animals/Vertebrates/gnatcatcher.jpg"}
