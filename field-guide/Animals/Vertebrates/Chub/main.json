{"organism":"yes","name":"Creek Chub","kingdom":"Animal","phylum":"Chordata","class":"Actinopterygii","order":"Cypriniformes","family":"Cyprinidae","genus":"","species":"","text":"Bait fish from the reservoir above make their way down into the creek. When we started the creek study in 1994 creek chub were regularly observed in large schools in the deeper pools. The largest chub caught was 18 cm. When we first began the study it was common to see them swimming in groups of four or more at site 3, 4,and 13. As of spring 1997 none have been observed. The numbers of bass and blue gill seem to be relatively stable. We are not clear if these changes are the result of the impact of competition induced by other species of fish or if the last time the creek dried up caused their disappearance. The chubs pointed mouth, torpedo shaped body, and tendency to school in large numbers aids in it's identification. Creek chub feed on a wide variety of aquatic and terrestrial insect larvae and other invertebrates. Large creek chubs will eat small crayfish and fish.The specimens in the images shown on this page were caught in the fall, held in my classroom aquarium for observation, and then released back into the creek after winter rains.","convertedName":"Creek_Chub","link":2,"image":"images/Field_Guide/Animals/Vertebrates/chub.jpg"}
