We are not sure if sculpins are native to the Arroyo Delvalle but we have collected them on five different occasions since the creek study started. This sculpin was caught at the pool just below the Main Street Overpass. Their spotted coloration, large pectoral fins, and sharp spines visible in their dorsal fin makes identification relatively easy. The close up of the sculpin head was taken with the flex cam while the fish rested in a shallow dish of water. While in an aquarium in my classroom, the sculpin was observed eating insect larva and worms. We returned the fish to the creek after the winter rains","convertedName":"Sculpin","link":5,"image":"images/Field_Guide/Animals/Vertebrates/sculpin.jpg"}
