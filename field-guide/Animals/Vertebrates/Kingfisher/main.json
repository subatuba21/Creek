They have only been observed on three occasions since we started the study in 1994. In all three cases the bird was seen perching in the cottonwood trees near site 10. We have been unable to photograph this bird due to the infrequent sightings, perching in areas not conducive to photography, and the fact that when we do see this bird it is very sensitive to our presence and flies off in advance of our approach to photograph it. We do listen for them each time we approach hoping to be able to catch our own photo. The image displayed above was acquired from www.maxwaugh.com and offers an excellent example of what we typically see when the bird is sighted. This animal, as the name implies, is a fish eater. It is able to hover over the water looking for evidence of fish near the surface and then dives at the water to capture it with it's elongate beak. It's excellent vision and pinpoint accuracy makes it extremely successful and therefore a \"kingfisher\".","convertedName":"Kingfisher","link":23,"image":"images/Field_Guide/Animals/Vertebrates/kingfisher.jpg"}
