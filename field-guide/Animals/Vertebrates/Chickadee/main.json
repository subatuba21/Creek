{"organism":"yes","name":"Chestnut backed Chickadee","kingdom":"Animal","phylum":"Chordata","class":"Aves","order":"Piciformes","family":"Paridae","genus":"Poecile","species":"rufescens","text":"Chickadees are very active small birds that have a noticeable short neck and a large head making resemble to some degree a fluffy ball. the beak is noticeably thinner than finch beaks. The brown or black cap on their head helps to confirm their identification. Their food consists of a mixture of seeds and insects. They are almost always heard singing in the trees especially during morning hours while we work in the creek. They tend to be less shy than most bird species than we encounter but their high level of activity offers few opportunities to capture an image of high quality. These images were captured in the morning of May 2009.","convertedName":"Chestnut_backed_Chickadee","link":15,"image":"images/Field_Guide/Animals/Vertebrates/chickadee.jpg"}
