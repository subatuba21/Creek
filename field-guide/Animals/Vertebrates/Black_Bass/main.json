{"organism":"yes","name":"Large Mouth Black Bass","kingdom":"Animal","phylum":"Chordata","class":"Actinopterygii","order":"Perciformes","family":"Centrarchidae","genus":"Micropterus","species":"salmoides","text":"Dissolved oxygen levels in those areas capable of supporting juvenile and adult fish, is realtively low. Low DO tolerant fish, like the large mouth black bass can be found in the deeper pools. Bass measuring over 30cm have been observed in areas of the Arroyo study site. Sitings are most common in spring through fall. We have made two attempts to sample the bass population through capture and release methods but have collected little data. We eventually felt that our attempts may cause more harm than good and we limited our sampling to species identification and only once a year. Due to the angle of light striking the water, it is easiest to view bass and other large fish late morning to early afternoon. The largemouth black bass is easily recognized by the rather large black band on both sides of the body. They are typically seen patrolling along the banks of the creek looking for prey consisting of aquatic insects, crayfish, and mosquito fish. The bass above was captured and held in my classroom aquarium for two days before being released back into the creek. The image above right was taken while the fish was in a fish viewer. This device prevents the fish from changing position so that a good photograph can be taken.","convertedName":"Large_Mouth_Black_Bass","link":0,"image":"images/Field_Guide/Animals/Vertebrates/blackbass.jpg"}
