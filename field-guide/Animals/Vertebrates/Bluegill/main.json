Low DO tolerant fish, like the bluegill, are often seen motionless near the surface of the deeper pools, this especially true when temperatures are high and DO levels are at their lowest. In cooler temperatures their activity level significantly increases. In the Spring of 2006 a mating pair of bluegill were observed just off the bank at site 6. The female would periodically swim in a circle with rapid burst so as to create a algae free depression in the silt and sand on the creek bottom. The male would be displaying heightened coloration while waiting for some sort of cue from the female. When the time was right he would quickly move beneath her as she was laying her eggs (below left). The area seemed to have a substantial amount of algae blocking access to black bass in the deeper areas of the pool. Bluegill feed primarily on aquatic insects, worms, and small fish. They are easily recognized by the dark blue coloration on the upper part of their gill cover.","convertedName":"Bluegill","link":1,"image":"images/Field_Guide/Animals/Vertebrates/bluegill.jpg"}
