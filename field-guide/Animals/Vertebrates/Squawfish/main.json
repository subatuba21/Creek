{"organism":"yes","name":"Squawfish","kingdom":"Animal","phylum":"Chordata","class":"Actinopterygii","order":"Cypriniformes","family":"Cyprinidae","genus":"Ptychocheilus","species":"","text":"The Sacramento Squawfish is a member of the family Cyprinidae also known as the minnow family. It, along with the carp and a few others, were introduced by anglers into the California waterways as a bait fish. It now has become well established and adversely affected endemic game fish like bluegill and black bass. They feed mostly on bottom dwelling invertebrates by a process called \"grubbing\". This specimen was caught at site 7. The orange tint on its caudal fin along with it's turned down mouth allows for easy identification from the creek bank. From 1994-1998 observations of squaw fish had been on the rise. Since the last time the creek dried up in 1999 we have not observed or collected this species.","convertedName":"Squawfish","link":4,"image":"images/Field_Guide/Animals/Vertebrates/squawfish.jpg"}
