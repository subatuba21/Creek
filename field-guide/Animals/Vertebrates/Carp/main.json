They tend to be a bit shy and make their presence known in only brief momemnts as they swim to a side of the creek away from us. It is a brief view of the barbels on their mouths that enable us to identify them. When the herbicide was spilled into the creek in 1996 there were several carp that were seen floating dead in the water. The largest observed was 61cm. Carp are bottom feeding scavengers and tend to become more of a nuisance than help for the stability of fresh water ecosystems. They have been known to significantly decrease the diversity of fish and amphibians in natural systems.
