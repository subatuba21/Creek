{"organism":"yes","name":"Black Phoebe (flycatcher)","kingdom":"Animal","phylum":"Chordata","class":"Aves","order":"Passeriformes","family":"Tyrannidae","genus":"Sayornis","species":"nigricans","text":"The Black Phoebe is a flycatcher that frequents aquatic habitats. They perch in branches and wait for insects to fly within their range. When spotting an insect they quickly fly into the air and capture their prey while in flight with a rather abrupt in flight maneuver. The bird shown here was watched for approximately 20 minutes, at site 8 & 9, moving between two primary perch sites and capturing insects that were flying between them. We witnessed easily 30 or more insects being eaten during that time period. The image lower left was luckily captured while the bird changed direction to capture an insect just before it settled on one of it's two preferred perches. During mating season these birds can be observed capturing minnows from the water to feed to their nestlings. Their call is fairly distinctive and helped in our identification ( listen to it's call).","convertedName":"Black_Phoebe_(flycatcher)","link":17,"image":"images/Field_Guide/Animals/Vertebrates/flycatcher.jpg"}
