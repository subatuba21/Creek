They are generally found around the banks of the creek burrowing in the soil and mud. This earthworm, unlike all others observed so far, was collected using the kicknet. We felt that it was a bit unusual to find an earthworm apparently thriving in the creek bed. We are not sure if this is normal or influenced by the drying up of the creek that took place in August 2000.The worm was very active and showed no evidence of being adversely impacted by being submerged in water. Earthworms breathe through their skin. Water carries much less oxygen and most earthworms prefer to be in moist soil in order to have a high enough oxygen content in the air spaces of the soil and at the same time avoiding light that could lead to desiccation. In October 2008 we collected what appears to be a baby earthworm in our plankton net (shown below). The photograph was taken with our flex cam at about 1.5 cm above the worm (mag appx 30x). The worm is segmented and reveals a movement typical to what you would expect to see in an earthworm. There are some features (digestive anatomy, the tip of the posterior end, and the fact that it was collected in the water) that make us wonder if this worm may be some aquatic species of segmented worm rather than an earthworm.
