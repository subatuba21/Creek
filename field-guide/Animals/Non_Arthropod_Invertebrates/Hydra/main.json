This phyla includes jellyfish, sea anemone, coral, and colonial hydrozoa. They are characterized by possessing tentacles with stinging cells (Cnidocytes). The stinging cells cotain a coiled fibrous protein that is tipped with venom used to paralyze their prey or fend off potential predators. When an organism bumps into cnidocytes on the tentacles they set off a trigger on the stinging cells which discharges the coiled protein which penetrates the flesh of its prey. Most species venom can not be detected by humans (hydra), while some species can be lethal (box jelly). The hydra feeds primarily on small swimming crustaceans.
