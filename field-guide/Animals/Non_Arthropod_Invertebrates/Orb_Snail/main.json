{"organism":"yes","name":"Orb Snail","kingdom":"Animal","phylum":"Mollusca","class":"Gastropoda","order":"","family":"","genus":"","species":"","text":"Some species of snail can tolerate significant changes in water quality and therefore tend to be found in all areas of the creek all of the time. We typically see two main groups gilled (pond) snails and orb (ramshorn) snails. If water quality is bad we tend to see predominantly pouched snails. If water quality is moderate or above we see both orb (above right) and pouched snails. They are most commonly found among lush growths of algae. They use their file like tongues to scrape off nutrient material from both plants and algae. Their eggs are often found on the underside of rocks like the image shown below. The first two images in the sequence were taken with a hand held digital camera using the macro option. The second two in the sequence were taken with the flex cam attached to a microscope.
