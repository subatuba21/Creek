{"organism":"yes","name":"Oligochaete ?","kingdom":"Animal","phylum":"Annelida","class":"Oligochaeta","order":"","family":"","genus":"","species":"","text":"The specimen showed above possesses many wormlike attributes while the presence of eyes seems to suggest an insect larva stage. We spent several hours attempting to identify this organism with no result having a high degree of confidence. We decided to temporarily place it in the phylum that includes segmented worms. Wave like peristaltic contractions in its gut were quite evident. Setae like bristles can be seen on every segment. The typical combination of circular and longitudnal muscle contraction seen in most annelids was very evident as well. There are many types of fresh water segmented worms which would include leeches, earthworms, and Oligochaetes. It is highly likely we have not classified this organisms correctly and would very much appreciate assistance from experts in the field to assist with it's correct classification.
