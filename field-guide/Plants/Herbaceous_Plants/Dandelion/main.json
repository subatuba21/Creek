Most appear in late fall and can be found untill late spring. They are low growing weeds with a circular ring of lobed leaves that get wider farther away from the stem. A reddish colored vein is commonly seen in the center of the leaf. Yellow flowers are common in early spring. They are commonly visited by bees and flies which initiate pollination. As the seeds begin to mature the yellow flowers give rise to a ball shaped arrangement of seeds (below left). The seeds are equipped with feathery extensions that catch the wind and float away dispersing them great distance away from the parent plant.","convertedName":"Dandelion","link":"12","image":"images/Field_Guide/Plants/Herbaceous_Plants/dandelion.jpg"}
