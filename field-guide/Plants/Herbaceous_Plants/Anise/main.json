{"organism":"yes","name":"Anise","kingdom":"Plantae","phylum":"Magnoliophyta","class":"Magnoliopsida","order":"Apiales","family":"Apiaceae","genus":"Pimpinella","species":"anisum","text":"Anise, sometimes called the liccorice plants, forms cloud like masses of feathery slender leaves that originate from the base of the stem. Stalks will be formed in early spring that hold clusters of small yellow flowers (below left). Bees and butterflies frequently visit the flowers for pollen and nectar. The Anise Swallowtail lays its eggs on the narrow leaves that eventualy hatch into small black catepilars with a white band across the central part of its body. It very nicely mimics bird dung. As the catepilar gets larger its color changes to yellow, green and black markings, at this stage it feasts on the flowers. This plant can be scattered about the entire creek study area but is most noticeable along the bank near sites one and two.","convertedName":"Anise","link":"10","image":"images/Field_Guide/Plants/Herbaceous_Plants/anise.jpg"}
