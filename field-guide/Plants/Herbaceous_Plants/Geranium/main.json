They can be found on the dry south facing bank as you enter the creek channel and in the comparatively moist shaded area among the eucalyptus trees. The plants receiving direct sun seem to grow the largest and form the most flowers (lower left). Their growth is most rapid in late winter and early spring when water is readily available and temperatures begin to warm. Their large leaves, which makes their identification very easy, have a rubbery like texture and a memorable aroma.","convertedName":"Geranium","link":14,"image":"images/Field_Guide/Plants/Herbaceous_Plants/geranium.jpg"}
