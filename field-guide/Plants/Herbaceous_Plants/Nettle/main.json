It is a perennial herb that does not grow much more than 75cm in the study area. Leaves grow in whorls, are pointed at the tip, and serrated at the edges. Stems and leaves generally have numerous hairs, many of which transfer a stinging irritant to the skin when touched. The sting usually swells in a matter of a few minutes. Flowers can be seen in mid spring and are found at the tips of the stems.","convertedName":"Stinging_Nettle","link":13,"image":"images/Field_Guide/Plants/Herbaceous_Plants/nettle.jpg"}
