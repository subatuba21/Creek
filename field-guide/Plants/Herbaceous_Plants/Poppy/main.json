They generally most abundant on the south facing bank as you enter the creek study area from the Main street bridge. Their bluish green grass like leaves are present in late winter and the bright orange flowers follow as soon as temperature begins to warm up. They form complete flowers containing both ovule and pollen producing organs and are dependent upon insects to support pollination. Soon after pollination the petals fall off and a conical seed pod becomes visible.","convertedName":"California_Poppy","link":18,"image":"images/Field_Guide/Plants/Herbaceous_Plants/poppies.jpg"}
