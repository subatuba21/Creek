The grass sends out horizontal stems at ground levels that establish roots and then send up new mature plants. This growth pattern allows them to extend the species across moits ground or in water up to several cm deep at a very rapid rate. Their flowering structures (above right and below left) are fromed in early spring.","convertedName":"Common_Reed","link":0,"image":"images/Field_Guide/Plants/Herbaceous_Plants/comreed.jpg"}
