{"organism":"yes","name":"Cattail","kingdom":"Plantae","phylum":"Magnoliophyta","class":"Liliopsida","order":"Poales","family":"Typhaceae","genus":"Typha","species":"","text":"Typha species often grow to cover large areas of wetlands, lakes and rivers. They are among the most common of all aquatic and wetland plants anywhere. Cat-tails get their name from their brown cylindrical flower spikes which can be more than 1 ft. long. They depend upon wind to blow their seeds away from the parent plant. The brown flowers take on a white fuzzy appearance at this time. Cat-tails provide protective cover and nesting areas for animals and birds. As a result of them doing so well in creeks and wetlands they can become a problem with flood control in channels with low banks. the Arroyo Delvalle channel is high enough so this is not likely to become a problem. :","convertedName":"Cattail","link":5,"image":"images/Field_Guide/Plants/Herbaceous_Plants/cattail.jpg"}
