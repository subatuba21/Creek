The leaves are connected to the base of the plant by a narrow petiole and have three to five parallel veins that diverge as you move away from the stem. Their blade like leaves will be darker green when water is plentiful and lighter green in areas where water is less abundant. The flowers are formed on conical shaped structures borne on stems that stick up much higher than the ground hugging leaves. The flowers are most commonly seen in the spring. These plants are fed upon by the larva of many species of butterfly and therefore caterpillars can be found grazing on the leaves and flowers during the spring.","convertedName":"Plantain","link":"7","image":"images/Field_Guide/Plants/Herbaceous_Plants/plantain.jpg"}
