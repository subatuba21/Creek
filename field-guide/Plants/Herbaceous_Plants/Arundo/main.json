{"organism":"yes","name":"Arundo","kingdom":"Plantae","phylum":"Magnoliophyta","class":"Liliopsida","order":"Poales","family":"Poaceae","genus":"Arundo","species":"","text":"Arundo is an invasive bamboo like grass that grows very quickly and has the potential to force out native grasses if left un-contained. Stems of this grass can get over 3 meters tall and have diameters exceeding 4cm. It can easily be mistaken for bamboo. In the early stages of our study it was extremely abundant along the banks of the creek (below left). Every fall a team of workers would enter the creek and chop down the large grass for flood control purposes. Each spring the arundo would return and once again in late fall would grow so thick in some areas that viewing the water was not possible. Flood control finally gave way to the use of herbicides to destroy the root systems of the invasive arundo. This treatment turned out to be very effective for removing the invasive grass but also wiped out most of the fauna in the creek for several months and has likely permanently disrupted the original diversity of the creek. In the meanwhile, the arundo has begun to return. The image in the upper right was taken 5/08. Flowers on this grass have yet to be observed.","convertedName":"Arundo","link":"6","image":"images/Field_Guide/Plants/Herbaceous_Plants/arundo.jpg"}
