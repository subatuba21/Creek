We observed this specimen at site 6 in the heavily shaded area under the eucalyptus trees. When it bloomed in early spring the flowers that formed were yellow and initially tubular shaped. As the flower matured their tubular shape disappered. The leaves have the typical clover like arrangement but the leaves are much more heart shaped than what is typically seen in true clover.","convertedName":"Wood_Sorrel_(Sour_Grass)","link":"17","image":"images/Field_Guide/Plants/Herbaceous_Plants/sorrel.jpg"}
