In May, small yellow flowers (.5cm - .75cm) can be seen borne on stalks that extend above the ground hugging leaves. The flower appears to be that of a group of plants referred to as violets. Our specimen resembles the Douglas Violet but has differences in laef structure that makes our classification of this plant difficult.","convertedName":"Wild_Violet","link":21,"image":"images/Field_Guide/Plants/Herbaceous_Plants/wildviolet.jpg"}
