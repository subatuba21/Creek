It seems to do best where grasses, sedges, and reeds are not able to fully get established due to human traffic or limited water supply. The cocklebur first appear in the winter when water is plentiful. At this time the plant forms low growing stems with tiny narrow leaves. In early spring the weed forms yellow flowers which are also located close to the ground. Due to the harshness of the areas in which this weed is most common, these plants are some of the first to dry. Their seeds are enclosed in hard dry structures surrounded by spikes. The spikes make dispersal in animal fur or the socks of humans very likely.","convertedName":"Cocklebur","link":"11","image":"images/Field_Guide/Plants/Herbaceous_Plants/cocklebur.jpg"}
