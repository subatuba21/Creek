{"organism":"yes","name":"Wild Oat","kingdom":"Plantae","phylum":"Magnoliophyta","class":"Liliopsida","order":"Poales","family":"Poaceae","genus":"Avena","species":"sativa","text":"Oat grass can be found throughout the entire study site. It is most abundant on the south facing bank of the creek channel (below right). It first appears in winter when the rains begin. At this time the grass is green and growing rapidly as temperatures begin to warm. By late spring the grass has flowered, been pollinated by the wind, and can be seen beginning to dry (top right). By late spring the bank is covered by dried straw like oat plants with many still having their opened flowers attached (bottom left). It is very common to hear snakes and lizards moving through the dried grass in late spring.","convertedName":"Wild_Oat","link":"8","image":"images/Field_Guide/Plants/Herbaceous_Plants/wildoat.jpg"}
