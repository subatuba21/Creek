{"organism":"yes","name":"Crabgrass","kingdom":"Plantae","phylum":"Magnoliophyta","class":"Liliopsida","order":"Poales","family":"Poaceae","genus":"Digitaria","species":"","text":"Crabgrass is a very common weed found in the creek study site as well as throughout all of Pleasanton and beyond. This invasive weed can establish itself in a myriad of different ecological conditions and competes very well with most other species of grass. Larger plants like trees and shrubs may establish enough shade and acquire enough nutrients from the soil to keep crabgrass growth in check. We notice crabgrass most often along the creek trail where lesser weeds can not manage the more extreme conditions of hard ground, less moisture, and significant exposure. It does act as a foraging food for many plant eating organisms.","convertedName":"Crabgrass","link":4,"image":"images/Field_Guide/Plants/Herbaceous_Plants/crabgrass.jpg"}
