  "text": "The presence or absence of a plant species may be a consequence of a variety of different circumstances. Some species are seasonal only being present in the spring, summer, or fall months when environmental conditions support their growth and reproductive cycles. Many species will only be present in areas of the creek where water quality is at it's absolute best. Invasive species, such as blackberry, may prevent native species of shrub, like the thimbleberry, from maintaining it's presence. Plants that thrive along the banks of the creek channel include perennial shrubs and trees as well as annual grasses and herbs. Since the beginning of our study we have witnessed a number of changes in plant diversity within the creek. One of our goals is to attempt to understand these changes amd determine if the changes are a natural part of the creeks movement toward stability or if other factors may be in play. To simplify your ability to learn about the plants we have found in our study site we have divided the species into three main categories. Click on the group of interest to learn more.",
