Daffodils are not native to the Arroyo but have likely been planted because they are beautiful while in bloom (late winter / early spring) and are relatively hardy plants. Their bulbs can survive the heat of the summer and shoot up new growth when water becomes available. Their narrow blade like leaves with parallel veins reveal tat they are examples of monocotyledons.","convertedName":"Daffodil","link":"22","image":"images/Field_Guide/Plants/Herbaceous_Plants/daffodil.jpg"}
