It is generally most common in areas that get direct sun and experiences significant drying in the summer months. In late winter the leaves become visible forming a snow flake like arrangement ( above right) with their branched veins having a white coloration. many very sharp spikes protrude from the leaves. In late spring the thistle will form a single flower on a stalk from the center of the plant (below left). Bumblebees seems to be the primary pollinator. The flower is also equipped with many sharp spines. The seed pod appears to hold multiple seeds that are dropped in mid to late summer.","convertedName":"Star_Thistle","link":23,"image":"images/Field_Guide/Plants/Herbaceous_Plants/thistle.jpg"}
