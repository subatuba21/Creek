It had clusters of very tiny white flowers that had 6 petals. The laves are lanceloate and bipinately compound. The small fruit (.5-1cm) that are formed after polination at first glance look like they are encased in a soft fuzzy capsule. A closer look reveals that they are covered by sharp spines. Any help that may be provided to help us identify this plant would be greatly appreciated.","convertedName":"Unknown?","link":"20","image":"images/Field_Guide/Plants/Herbaceous_Plants/unknown.jpg"}
