{"organism":"yes","name":"Duckweed","kingdom":"Plantae","phylum":"(Angiosperm)","class":"(Monocotyledon)","order":"Alismatales","family":"Araceae","genus":"","species":"","text":"Duckweed is a very small flowering plant (see below left on my finger tip) that floats on the surface of the water. Ducks are commonly seen swimming through and foraging on these plants which may be the reason for it's common name. Spring and summer is when duckweed is most abundant in the creek. Large floating mats (like what is shown above) of this plant can cover 50% or more of the calm areas of the creek. They can become so abundant that they block light penetration and decrease productivity at the bottom of pools covered by their growth. Towards the end of summer many of the plants reveal a color change from green to purple. We are not aware if this is a consequence of a maturation in it's life cycle or if it is caused by the much higher temperatures present at the time. Winter brings significant runoff which scours nearly all of the duckweed out of the channel. The small number of plants remaining experience rapid growth as temperatures increase and water flow subsides leading to an abundance of plants once again in the summer.","convertedName":"Duckweed","link":26,"image":"images/Field_Guide/Plants/Herbaceous_Plants/duckweed.jpg"}
