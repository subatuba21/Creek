The small green leaves have serrated edges and the stems possess spines. The flowers appear in early spring (shown below) are generally a reddish pink in color. They are frequently visited by honey bees, bumble bees, and butterflies. A pod (below right) is formed at the end of the flower stem that drops seeds in the fall. It appears that it was originally planted as part of the restoration process in 2005. The plants seem to be doing well and have established new plants further down from the site where they were originally planted.","convertedName":"Wild_Rose","link":13,"image":"images/Field_Guide/Plants/Woody_Plants/wildrose.jpg"}
