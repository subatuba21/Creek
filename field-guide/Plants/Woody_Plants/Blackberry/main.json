{"organism":"yes","name":"BlackBerry","kingdom":"Plantae","phylum":"Magnoliophyta","class":"Magnoliopsida","order":"Rosales","family":"Rosaceae","genus":"Rubus","species":"","text":"This common evergreen bush trails over the ground or climbs over other vegetation. Slender straight thorns line the stems that are green (below left) when newly formed and turn a reddish color (above right) in more mature parts of the plant. The leaves are doubly serrate and usually in groups of 3-5 leaflets. Flowers (below right) appear in the early spring, are white in color, and usually in clusters of three or more. The flowers are complete in that they have both pollen forming (stamens) and ovule forming (carpels) structures. The fruit that are formed are first red in color (above right) but become black when fully ripe. Blackberry plants are most concentrated in places on the north facing bank but are common on the south facing as well. Their sharp spines and tangles of branches create a near impenetrable barrier. The blackberry plants are not endemic species and commonly force out native species as it creeps along the creek channel. They were planted by local residents in an effort to keep trespassers off of their property.","convertedName":"BlackBerry","link":0,"image":"images/Field_Guide/Plants/Woody_Plants/blackberry.jpg"}
