{"organism":"yes","name":"Holly","kingdom":"Plantae","phylum":"Magnoliophyta","class":"Magnoliopsida","order":"Aquifoliales","family":"Aquifoliaceae","genus":"Ilex","species":"","text":"The American Holly bush is a very popular ornamental plant found in the yards of many Pleasanton resdidents. They are not an endemic species to the creek channel. We believe that either a bird ate the berries from a plant nearby and dropped seed in the area in which this bush was found (just beyond site 14 among the eucalyptus trees near the creek) or berries were thrown/planted by people visiting the creek. Their leaves have numerous sharp spines along their edges and a thick shiny cuticle covering their surface. Flowers may form in the fall and winter with bright red berries being formed in the spring.","convertedName":"Holly","link":17,"image":"images/Field_Guide/Plants/Woody_Plants/holly.jpg"}
