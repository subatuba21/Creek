{"organism":"yes","name":"Willow","kingdom":"Willow","phylum":"Magnoliophyta","class":"Magnoliopsida","order":"Malpighiales","family":"Salicaceae","genus":"Salix","species":"","text":"Willows are common along the banks of the creek. They grow along the edge or actually in the water at the edge of the creek bank. In some places they form dense thickets making it difficult to gain access to the creek water. Their leaves are long and narrow, (appx 1cm wide) pointed at the ends, and not seratted. Flowers form in the late spring and are white in color (lower left). Leaf galls, small yellowish brown swellings in the leaf tissue, are common. At site four frogs take cover among the branches that have bent over into the water. Other wildlife, like ducks, commonly will be heard or seen in the water around areas where the willows form dense thickets. These plants grow best in moist soils and along stream banks. They establish excellent erosion control.","convertedName":"Willow","link":7,"image":"images/Field_Guide/Plants/Woody_Plants/willow.jpg"}
