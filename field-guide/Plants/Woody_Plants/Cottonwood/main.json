The largest trees, approximately 12-18m, are seen at site 2 by the main Street Bridge and site 10 just before the railroad tressel. They grow best in areas where shade is common and moisture is readily available. Their large rounded leaves with serated edges and pointed tips form large canopies that provides a substanial amount of shade in the late spring and early summer. Their leaves turn a beautiful yellow color and then are dropped in the fall. It is at this time that they add substantial organic matter to the creek (below left) . Flowers that form eventually release large amounts of cotton like fibers that are carried in the breeze and litter the creek trail (above and below right). :","convertedName":"Fremont_Cottonwood","link":5,"image":"images/Field_Guide/Plants/Woody_Plants/cottonwood.jpg"}
