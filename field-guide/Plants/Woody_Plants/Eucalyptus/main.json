It appears that many varieties were planted for erosion control. At site 10 a large grove of trees exists establishing a very shaded and somewhat secluded section of the creek. The trees along site 6 add substantial amounts of organic matter to the large pool of water that exists there. The leaves are long and slender, slightly bent, tapered at the ends, and have a slight bluish green tint. Leaf galls are usually abundant. The flowers that form in the late winter or early spring have numerous stamens and no petals. Small top shaped fruit that develop after pollination help to make the creek trail a bit more challenging for joggers and bikers.","convertedName":"Eucalyptus","link":8,"image":"images/Field_Guide/Plants/Woody_Plants/eucalyptus.jpg"}
