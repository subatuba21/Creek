{"organism":"yes","name":"Valley Oak","kingdom":"Plantae","phylum":"Magnoliophyta","class":"Magnoliopsida","order":"Fagales","family":"Fagaceae","genus":"Quercus","species":"lobata","text":"The Valley Oak trees in the study site are mostly young trees growing in and around the planted euclayptus trees. Many appear as shrub like growths just of the path along the creek bank. Unlike the Coast Live Oak, their leaves are significantly lobed, possess no spines along their edges, and are comparitively much less rigid. There are very few acorns produced as a result of their small size. As they mature more acorns would be available and those organisms that thrive on acorns should become more noticeable. California Indians used to collect the acorns from the Valley Oak and grind them into a mush that could be used to make bread. Fall leads to some evidence of color change (lower left). A fairly common site is the presence of galls (lower right). These are generally formed when oak wasps lay their eggs in the branches. A large tumor like growth eventaully appears which ultimately provides nourishment for the developing larva as well as protecting them from predators and the elements.","convertedName":"Valley_Oak","link":15,"image":"images/Field_Guide/Plants/Woody_Plants/valleyoak.jpg"}
