{"organism":"yes","name":"Elder","kingdom":"Plantae","phylum":"Magnoliophyta","class":"Magnoliopsida","order":"Dipsacales","family":"Adoxaceae","genus":"Sambucus","species":"","text":"Elders are mostly shrubs that are common in both the Northern and Southern Hemisphere. They form small yellowish white colored flowers in the spring which lead to the development of bluish black berries in the Fall. The berries act as a source of food for many species of bird as well as mammals like raccoons and opossum. This specimen was observed near the trail head and appears to have been planted as part of the restoration project. We believe it is a Mexican Elder as a consequence of its leaves with serrated edges.","convertedName":"Elder","link":12,"image":"images/Field_Guide/Plants/Woody_Plants/elder.jpg"}
