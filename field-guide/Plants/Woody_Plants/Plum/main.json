{"organism":"yes","name":"Plum Tree","kingdom":"Plantae","phylum":"Magnoliophyta","class":"Magnoliopsida","order":"Rosales","family":"Rosaceae","genus":"Prunus","species":"americana","text":"Plum tree species were first identified in the spring of 2008. A tree approximately 4m tall near site 9 was seen with fruit that validated the classification. The small oval leaves have small serrations around the entire leaf. It is likely that either the tree is a consequence of neighborhood trees having their fruit carried into the creek channel by animals or a fruit was intentionally planted by a creek visitor.","convertedName":"Plum_Tree","link":11,"image":"images/Field_Guide/Plants/Woody_Plants/plum.jpg"}
