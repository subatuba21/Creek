{"organism":"yes","name":"Ficus","kingdom":"Plantae","phylum":"Magnoliophyta","class":"Magnoliopsida","order":"Rosales","family":"Moraceae","genus":"Ficus","species":"","text":"Ficus has many species some which are trees, others that are shrubs, and still others that form vines. Some species are Keystone Species in tropical rain forests. The Ficus species seen in our creek study area is found only in very shaded areas where moisture will be available all year round. They appear as small trees in the under story of established eucalyptus and cottonwoods. The group is collectively known as figs. The fruit that some species form is an extremely important food source for both humans as well as wildlife. We have not yet seen the ficus trees in our study area flower at this point. Students have hypothesized that this may be a consequence of their small size combined with the fact they are only able to get established in areas with limited sun exposure. It may also be a consequence of their variety. The leaves are very distinctive and make their identification fairly easy.","convertedName":"Ficus","link":6,"image":"images/Field_Guide/Plants/Woody_Plants/ficus.jpg"}
