{"organism":"yes","name":"Sycamore","kingdom":"Plantae","phylum":"Magnoliophyta","class":"Magnoliopsida","order":"Proteales","family":"Platanaceae","genus":"Platanus","species":"","text":"The Sycamores at the study site are commonly seen at the top of the bank along the creek channel. Some of these trees are very mature form huge leaf canopies and are approximately 15m tall. New trees have recently been planted within the channel at site one. The very large star shaped leaves make them easily identified. In the autumn their leaves change in color and become brown, as the tree prepares for dormancy. Their leaves accumulate in large numbers in the creek and contribute to a substantial amount of organic matter in the areas of the creek with little current. In the late spring and summer months flowers form that eventaully lead to the formation of fruit. The fruit are present into the winter months and are often most visible at that time (lower left). The fruit are actually a ball of tightly packed seeds that are approximately 1.5cm, surrounded by tiny hairs, and dispersed in the wind in late winter. Squirrels are often seen scrambling around in the upper branches.","convertedName":"Sycamore","link":9,"image":"images/Field_Guide/Plants/Woody_Plants/sycamore.jpg"}
