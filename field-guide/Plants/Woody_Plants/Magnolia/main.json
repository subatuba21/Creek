{"organism":"yes","name":"Magnolia","kingdom":"Plantae","phylum":"Angiosperms","class":"Magnoliopsida","order":"Magnoliales","family":"Magnoliaceae","genus":"Magnolia","species":"","text":"There are two Magnolia trees located in the study area. They both can be found on the South Facing creek bank at site 5. Apparently the eucalyptus trees located near waters edge are casting enough of a shadow on the creek bank to support the water needs of these trees. They do appear to have limited growth in the areas of both leaf formation as well as trunk size. Magnolia trees are an ornamental tree that are not native to the area but the tree has been planted in the yards of many Pleasanton residents. We can not be sure if the tree was planted by previous land owners or if the seeds of a mature tree had arrived by some other means. Flowers appear in mid to late spring and on this variety are white in color. We have witnessed a direct correlation between rainfall amount and leaf production by the trees.","convertedName":"Magnolia","link":16,"image":"images/Field_Guide/Plants/Woody_Plants/magnolia.jpg"}
