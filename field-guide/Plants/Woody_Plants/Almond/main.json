Numerous trees have established themselves in the creek study site. The mature trees can be found at the entry into the creek channel and at site 6-9 on the south facing bank of the channel. The tallest trees seen in the study area are approximately 6m tall. Their trunks about 20cm in diameter. Young almond trees (below right) can be found in the shade established by mature tree species. The trees form flowers in spring and fruit become visible (lower left) by May and remain on the trees through summer. The non ripe fruit have a thick fuzzy covering that likely makes it inedible. Squirrels are frequently observed foraging on the mature fruit.:","convertedName":"Almond_Tree","link":4,"image":"images/Field_Guide/Plants/Woody_Plants/almond.jpg"}
