In addition to being found on the North bank as you walk on the entry trail, it can also be found along the creek channel at site 1. The leaves of the ceanothus shrub are very small and have a sticky surface. The branches usually have a reddish tint to them. In late winter and spring they form beautiful clusters of small blue flowers (below left) that are visited by an assortment of bees, flies, and butterflies. They do well in the summer with little water but are generally much drier looking and lose the green luster on their leaves (lower right).","convertedName":"Ceanothus_(California_lilac)","link":10,"image":"images/Field_Guide/Plants/Woody_Plants/ceanothus.jpg"}
