They are most commonly seen growing on the surfaces of rocks, tree branches, and along the concrete in shaded areas of the Main Street Bridge. Mosses do not produce seeds during their life cycle. The green carpet like cluster of tiny green plants will carry out sexual reproduction by releasing sperm when covered by a film of water. The sperm are chemically attracted to the female plants. Once the sperm has fertilized the egg a stalk like structure will grow from the fertilized egg at the top of the female plant. At the end of the stalk will appear a capsule which will eventually contain hundreds of tiny spores. As the capsule dries the spores are discharged into the air. If the spores settle in a suitable environment they will then grow into new tiny green plants and establish another moss colony. There are two main types of mosses, Acrocarpous (small clumps of upright plants that form their capsules at the tips of the moss plant) and Pleurocarpous (small creeping branching plants, seen above and below left, that form their capsules from side branches).","convertedName":"Moss_(pleurocarpous_variety)","link":0,"image":"images/Field_Guide/Plants/Seedless_Plants/pleuro_moss.jpg"}
