They tend to be most abundant in the late Spring through the early Fall. The specimen above was photographed using the flex cam attached to a microscope set at 100 magnification. The green internal coloration suggests to us that this species is likely to graze on algae. Their curled lateraly flattened bodies make identifying these organisms a fairly easy task.
