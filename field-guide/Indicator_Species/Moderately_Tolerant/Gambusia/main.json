{"organism":"yes","name":"Gambusia (mosquito fish)","kingdom":"Animal","phylum":"Chordata","class":"Actinopterygii","order":"Cyprinodontiformes","family":"Poeciliidae","genus":"Gambusia","species":"","text":"Mosquito fish are common throughout the entire creek study site. They are most commonly found close to shore in areas where rate of low is minimal and aquatic vegetation is abundant. It seems apparent that the vegetation provides camoflauge needed to elude larger predatory fish like the black bass. These fish are not native to California streams and tributaries. They are planted into fresh water habitats as part of California's mosquito abatement program. They will be found wherever freshwater systems may pose a mosquito problem with the local populous. With the concern for the West Nile virus and many other mosquito transferred diseases, the mosquito fish is our number one ally. Their small size, upturned mouths, and tendency to stay at the surface of the water makes their identification relatively easy. They are often seen in small schools usually composed of several females (above right) and one or more males (below left). The males are much smaller than the females and have elongate pelvic fins which are used during copulation. The females are larger and have enlarged bellies when carryin offspring. Unlike the bluegill, Gambusia is a live bearer species. The image above right was taken while the fish was in a fish viewer. This device prevents the fish from changing position so that a good photograph can be taken. The photograph at the left was taken with the FlexCam while the fish was in a small glass container. The fish below right was photographed from above in a tray to reveal their recognizeable outline when seeing them in the creek.","convertedName":"Gambusia_(mosquito_fish)","link":3,"image":"images/Field_Guide/Animals/Vertebrates/gambusia.jpg"}
