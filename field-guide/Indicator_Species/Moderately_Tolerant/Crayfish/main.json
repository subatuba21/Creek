Being that they are somewhat sensitive to poor water quality they offer an easy qualittative aid in determining changes in water chemistry. If abundant in the fall crawdads are sometimes collected and bred in classroom tanks. The offspring produced are released back into the creek (female with eggs shown above - picture of a crawdad baby shown below was photographed in a petri dish using the flex cam). Crawdads are found throughout the creek study site but are most common in the deeper pools. These animals are scavangers. They will eat algae, aquatic plants, or dead fish when they become available.","convertedName":"Crawdad_(Crayfish)","link":"10","image":"images/Field_Guide/Animals/Arthropods/crayfish.jpg"}
