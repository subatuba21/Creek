{"organism":"yes","name":"Cyclops (Copepod)","kingdom":"Animal","phylum":"Arthropoda","class":"Crustacea","order":"Cyclopoida","family":"Cyclopidae","genus":"Cyclops","species":"","text":"The cyclops is an example of a common group microscopic crustaceans found in the creek called copepods. They filter algae and other organic substances as it swims through the water using its paired antennae. The single compound eye in the center of the head enables the cyclops to swim to areas where algae is likely to be abundant. The cyclops shown above was caught using a plankton net. The specimen was photographed at 40x magnification. The green sphere seen with it below left is a colonial algae known as Volvox. When zooplankton like the cyclops are abundant it is a sure sign that productivity of the creek is currently high. Eggs can often been seen attached to the hind appendages of females (top right and below left). The cyclops is capable of encapsulating itself and it's eggs in a thick mass of mucus in an effort to survive periods when water is limited or absent.","convertedName":"Cyclops_(Copepod)","link":"2","image":"images/Field_Guide/Animals/Arthropods/cyclops.jpg"}
