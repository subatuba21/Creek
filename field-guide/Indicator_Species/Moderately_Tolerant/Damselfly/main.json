Eggs are laid in the water and develop into a nymph stage (below left - somteimes referred to as a larvae) that molts several times as it grows and eventually emerges as the adult (shown above). The nymphs are carnivorous and as they mature they become excellent swimmers and can be observed using a side to side undulation of the body as they swim. Damsel fly nymphs are sensitive to low dissolved oxygen levels and and poor water quality and therefore can act as an indicator species. The nymphs are very distinct showing a characteristically large head, elongated body, and three appendages at the tip of their abdomen. The picture above shows a mating pair. Females are often observed bobbing up and down on the water as they deposit their eggs. Adult damsel flies feed on small insects like mosquitoes, flies, and gnats. They are easily distinguished from dragon flies by the way they fly (slower then dragon flies) and how they hold their wings when they land (folded together, unlike dragon flies that hold their wings out)","convertedName":"Damselfly","link":5,"image":"images/Field_Guide/Animals/Arthropods/damselfly.jpg"}
