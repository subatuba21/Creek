The adult is carnivorous and often eats small fish. It uses a needle like proboscis (below left - ventral surface) that it pierces into the flesh of its prey to draw out blood and other body fluids. The giant water bug is often called \"toe biter\". This is due to the fact that giant water bugs have been known to mistake a swimmers toe for a fish in murky water. This is a dorsal view of a giant water bug caught at creek site #11 and raised in an aquarium in my classroom.","convertedName":"Giant_Water_Bug","link":"8","image":"images/Field_Guide/Animals/Arthropods/waterbug.jpg"}
