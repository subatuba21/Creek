They are easy to spot in the water as they dart from the waters surface to the bottom in rapid jerky movements using its oar like front appendages. Once reaching the bottom they remain motionless in an attempt to blend in with their surroundings. They are air breathing insects and must return to the surface. The water boatman uses it's syringe like mouth part to inject saliva mixed with enzymes into algae or aquatic plants. The enzymes break down the plant material and converts it into a nutrient rich fluid which is then sucked back through the mouthpart and into the digestive system.","convertedName":"Water_Boatman","link":"9","image":"images/Field_Guide/Animals/Arthropods/boatman.jpg"}
