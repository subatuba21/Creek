Their numbers significantly increase as water quality decreases. They have typically been very small and had a brownish black color. The leech shown was one of five collected in a kicknet sample.The largest we have ever found has been approximately 8cm. The narrow anterior end is equipped with cutting mouth parts and the large posterior end has a sucker. The sucker is used to attach to their prey (usualy fish) while the cutting mouth parts create a wound so that blood can be drawn. Leeches produce a protein in their saliva (heparin) that prevents the preys wound from forming a clot. A synthetic version of this is used during surgeries to prevent clot formation. They move by undulations of the body in a \"S\" shape manner. Movie of a leech swimming.","convertedName":"Leech","link":9,"image":"images/Field_Guide/Animals/Non_Arthropod_Invertebrates//leech.jpg"}
