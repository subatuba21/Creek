Nematodes are extremely abundant in moist environments and can tolerate poor water quality. They are characterized by cyllindrical bodies that are tapered at both ends. The species we tend to find at the study site are microscopic in size. Unlike the planarians\\, they have a complete digestive system (mouth and anus). Food, organic debris, is funnelled into the mouth as it crawls and forced through the elongate digestive cavity by peristaltic muscular contractions. The nematode shown above was collected and photographed with the flex cam coupled to the ocular lens of a compound light microscope. The specimen was photographed at 100 magnification.","convertedName":"Nematode/Roundworm","link":6,"image":"images/Field_Guide/Animals/Non_Arthropod_Invertebrates//nematode.jpg"}
