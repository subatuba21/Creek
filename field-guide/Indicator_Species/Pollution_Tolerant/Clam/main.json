{"organism":"yes","name":"Freshwater Clam","kingdom":"Animal","phylum":"Mollusca","class":"Bivalvia","order":"Veneroida","family":"Sphaeriidae","genus":"","species":"","text":"Fresh water clams are occasionally collected with the kicknet. We most often are made aware of their presence by small mounds of empty shells created by foraging racoons. Racoon tracks can be spotted along the bank of the creek and are most abundant around site 6 and site 12. Clams are filter feeders. They bury themselves in the mud using an extendable \"foot\" and have siphons (incurrent and excurrent) that extend up out of their burrow into the water (shown below left is a clam in my classroom aquarium - the foot is attempting to initiate a burrow but the glass bottom is preventing it from forming one). They filter mostly phytoplankton (microscopic plant like organisms) and zooplankton (microscopic animal like organisms). A thin soft tissue called the mantle secretes the shell and forms a cavity in which the gills are located.","convertedName":"Freshwater_Clam","link":2,"image":"images/Field_Guide/Animals/Non_Arthropod_Invertebrates//clam.jpg"}
