We find them most frequently when bringing algae samples back to the classroom. They filter algae and other organic substances by using double rings of cilia located around their mouth. Food is swept into a grinding gullet which prepares it for digestion. The rotifer shown above was collected and photographed with the flex cam coupled to the ocular lens of a compound light microscope. The specimen was photographed at 400 magnification.","convertedName":"Rotifer","link":7,"image":"images/Field_Guide/Animals/Non_Arthropod_Invertebrates//rotifer.jpg"}
