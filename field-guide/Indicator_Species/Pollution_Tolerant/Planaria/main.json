{"organism":"yes","name":"Planaria","kingdom":"Animal","phylum":"Platyhelminthes","class":"Turbellaria","order":"Seriata","family":"Planariidae","genus":"","species":"","text":"Planaria are commonly found in the creek. We usually acquire large numbers of them when turning over rocks (below left). They are negatively phototactic (move away from light). this behavior is possible as a consequence of a pair of eye spots located at the head (see above). Moving away from light is likely to increase the probability of staying moist and avoiding dessication. Feeding is carried out by a muscular pharynx, located on the mid ventral surface, which sucks up organic matter from the substrate upon which it is crawling. Movement may be accomplished either by muscular contractions of the body wall or the use of cilia along the ventral surface. When using the cilia the planarian appears to be gliding across the surface (see movie clip). Planarians have remarkable regenerative properties and are often brought back to the classroom to study this ability.","convertedName":"Planaria","link":5,"image":"images/Field_Guide/Animals/Non_Arthropod_Invertebrates//planaria.jpg"}
