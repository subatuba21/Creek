{"organism":"yes","name":"Black Fly","kingdom":"Animal","phylum":"Arthropoda","class":"Insecta","order":"Diptera","family":"Simuliidae","genus":"","species":"","text":"Black flies are biting flies that are dependent upon blood meal like mosquitoes. In many parts of the world they transfer a variety of diseases to the host that they end up biting. They are sometimes referred to as buffalo gnats because the adults, while small, tend to be a bit bigger than most \"gnats\" and are most active at dusk. The larva are wormlike in appearance. They have suckers at the tip of their abdomen which allow them to attach to the surface of rocks in areas where water is moving. Their head possesses filtering structures that allows them to collect organic matter as it flows by. The larvae can also secrete a silk thread that is attached at one end to a rock so that they may carefully drift to a more desirable feeding area. Black fly larva are fed on by a number of carnivorous insects like dragonfly larva, damselfly larva, predacious diving beetles, dobson fly larva. If pollutant levels are high, the insects that would normally prey on black fly larva are in short supply therefore causing the population of black flies to soar in the area.","convertedName":"Black_Fly","link":0,"image":"images/Field_Guide/Animals/Arthropods/blackfly.jpg"}
