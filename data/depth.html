<h2>Depth</h2>
<p>We hope to develop a topographical map showing variations in depth of the creek. Our intention is to work with both math and physical science classes to compile such a map. At this time our method of measuring depths is crude but effective. A single meter stick works fine for most areas throughout most of the year. During the winter when there is significant increases in rate of flow and depth, two or more meter sticks are taped together as shown at the right. The area being measured was over 1.5 meters. Most of the year the same area is about 0.4 meters. Depth will impact the intensity and quality of light reaching producers on the bottom. Rooted producers on the bottom of creek bed decrease in diversity and abundance as depth and or turbidity increases. We have just purchased Vernier sensors that should enable us to more efficiently measure water depth and rate of flow. We look forward to using these new tools to create a more complete map of the creek bed.</p>
