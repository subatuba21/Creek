<h2>Temperature</h2>
<p>Temperature of the creek water can impact many biotic and abiotic condition in the creek. The warmer the temperature the greater the consumption of dissolved oxygen by organisms and the less DO the water can hold. As temperature rises some organisms become more active while others may decrease their activity or leave the water. Some organisms are very tolerant of warmer water while others are extremely sensitive to it. Algae tends to grow out of control during late spring and summer months when water temperatures are elevated. During hot days fish will be observed closer to the surface of the water where DO levels will be higher. Some species of fish, like carp, will come to the surface and gulp air into their guts to increase their absorption of oxygen. Exposure, depth of water, and rate of flow can all impact the temperature at a given site. Temperatures tend to be cooler in the areas shaded by tree cover (site 6 & 8) ad warmer in the exposed areas (site 4 & 5).</p>
<p>Temperature used to be taken using a cooking thermometer (above right). The thermometer would be pressed down into the creek bottom followed by it's removal about a minute later (Movie). Data is recorded and then temperature is taken at another site. In the Fall of 2007 we started using Vernier LabPro equipped with a temperature probe (below) which is connected to a laptop running Logger Pro Software. Both methods of collection are very easy to use and provide accurate enough readings for establishing a baseline needed for comparison purposes.</p>
