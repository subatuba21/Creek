<h2>Flow Rate</h2>
<p>Rate of flow of the water impacts many abiotic factors in the creek. Dissolved oxygen levels, temperature, bottom sediments, accumulation of pollutants, and pH are significantly impacted by depth and rate of flow. Creek species all attempt to locate themselves in optimal conditions where abiotic factors help to maintain an ideal internal environment. In many cases organisms will have to choose between a location where food may be more plentiful for a spot that has more ideal abiotic conditions. As a result of the creeks water quality being impacted by seasonal changes, changes that occur daily as temperature rises and falls, and as the result of the actions of members of our community, some organisms will migrate between these locations. Knowing variation in flow rate at specific locations can help us better understand why or why not certain species were collected. In most areas of the creek we estimate rate of flow by dropping a ping pong ball into the water and measuring the time it takes for the ball to travel 1m. We then convert the flow rate into cm/sec. When water levels are high, like during the winter, we use Vernier LabPro equipped with a Flow Rate sensitive probe which is connected to a laptop running Logger Pro Software.</p>
