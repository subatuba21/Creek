<h2>Dip Net</h2>
<p>Sampling aquatic life along the bank can help to provide a more complete picture of the health of our creek. The best location to collect using the dipnet are areas where the vegetation is abundant along waters edge. The dipnet should be quickly inserted into the vegetation in the water and rapidly dragged along the bank. Jerk the net up and down while dragging to facilitate a more rapid movement through the vegetation. Samplings of organisms are classified, counted, and then released back into the creek by the student team.One representative of each unknown species is brought back to the classroom for identification. Students look for indicator species in an effort to evaluate water quality. If water quality is fair to good, common species collected would include dragon fly larva, damsel fly larva, mosquito fish, and snails.</p>
