<h2>Garbage Control</h2>
<p>Our students are encouraged to Think Globally and Act Locally. Collection of bottles, cans, and litter from the creek study site by biology students is becoming common practice. Each time we visit the creek students pick up litter without a second thought and bring it to the garbage can at the head of the trail. The presence of litter is partly due to the visitors lack of respect for the environment and partly due to the close proximity to a number of food and convenient stores. Wind often carries material off of the Main street overpass and into the creek.</p>
<p>Our interest in cleaning the creek channel eventually developed into plans for an Earth Week "CleanUp of the Creek" Celebration. As it turns out, since we started the Creek Watch Project the amount of garbage noticed in the creek area has significantly decreased over the years. Where it was not uncommon to find a shopping cart, TV, tires, or even a camper shell, this type of debris has now become a rarity. We believe that by word of mouth our creek project has played a major role in decreasing accumulation of litter in the Arroyo. There will always be a few that will ignore the fact that their garbage may significantly interfere with the stability of a microhabitat as well as creating an eyesore. We believe that our efforts will continue to make progress in this area and hopefully help to establish an ecosystem that the community is proud of and will enjoy visiting.</p>
