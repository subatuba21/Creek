<h2>Kick Net</h2>
<p>Sampling aquatic life away from the bank will provide a more complete picture of the health of our creek. The kicknet offers an excellent way of sampling for creek invertebrates that may act as excellent indicators of water quality. The kicknet is best placed in an area where the water is moving fairly quickly. The net is placed at a 45 degree angle leaning down stream (right). While one or two students hold the net apart as far as possible, another student lifts rocks on the bottom and rubs them with their hands. This will dislodge invertebrates and cause them to get caught in the current and swept into the net. After turning over several stones the net is carefully lifted, bottom of net up, so as not to lose any specimens caught in the net. The net is then carried to an appropriate area of the bank and set on the ground so that organisms collected may be observed (below). Students look for anything that may be moving and collect one of each species to be brought back to the classroom in plastic containers. Samplings of organisms are classified, counted, and then released back into the creek by the student team . Students look for indicator species. Caddis fly larva, stonefly larva, and or Dobsonfly larva would suggest good water quality as a result of their sensitivity to pollutants. Leeches, snails, and midge fly larva would indicate poor water quality due to their tolerance of pollutants.
