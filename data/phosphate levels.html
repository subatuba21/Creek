<h2>Phosphate Levels</h2>
<p> Phosphates can come from the erosion of rock or by soaps and detergents entering the creek through storm drains. High phosphate levels, like nitrates, can encourage algae blooms and impact the pH of the creek.</p>
<p>A high concentration of phosphates in the creek can lead to algae blooms. Abundant algae will decrease light penetration (increase turbidity) and prevent bottom dwelling producers from receiving sufficient supplies of energy. These dieing bottom dwelling producers along with dead algae sinking down from the surface, leads to a significant increase in the number and activity of decomposers. DO levels near the bottom will drop to low to support most species of consumers.An optimum range of phosphates needs to be maintained to insure adequate supply for producers without triggering rapid algae growth and the subsequent problems described above. phosphate levels exceeding .6ppm are likely to cause detrimental algae blooms. Below are some of the phosphate levels seen in the Arroyo.</p>
<p>Currently we are using the Chemettes snap off test ampules to approximate the concentration of phosphates in ppm.
